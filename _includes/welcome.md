A new and exciting lab at Syracuse University,
    consisting of a [PI](People.html#john-m-franck),
    the first class of two graduate students,
    and three motivated undergraduates.

Research in the Franck lab is highly
    interdisciplinary,
    but also extremely accessible to students from
    a variety of backgrounds.
We employ a mix of
    chemical physics,
    biochemistry,
    analytical chemistry,
    and
    synthetic tools
    in order to develop unorthodox spectroscopic
    techniques that investigate how water interacts
    with the surfaces of proteins and soft materials.

***The Franck lab is looking for interested graduate students and
undergraduate researchers in Fall 2016***, and welcomes any inquiries.
(feel free to contact Dr. Franck by email (jmfranck at syr.edu)). Students in the Franck lab
will have the opportunity to work with materials or biological systems.
In addition, they will gain expertise developing new spectroscopic
methods using physics, electronics, and computer programming. Students
who capitalize on these opportunities will have a unique and powerful
skill-set.
