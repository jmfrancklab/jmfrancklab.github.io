The Franck lab is a brand new lab at Syracuse University.
Research in the Franck lab is highly interdisciplinary,
    but also extremely accessible to students from a variety of
    backgrounds.
We employ a mix of
    synthetic tools,
    biochemistry, analytical chemistry,
    and chemical physics.

Our work relies on a simple chemical labeling strategy:

Students in the Franck lab have the opportunity to learn
    and demonstrate experience in 
    a wide range of skills applicable to their future careers,
    ...
    in fact a broader range of opportunities than in a more
    traditional chemistry lab.

Students joining the Franck lab will
    have the opportunity to work with
    a unique combination of state-of-the-art instruments,
    as well as customized tools
    available nowhere else in the world.

Incoming students with an interest in chemical synthesis,
    analytical chemistry, spectroscopy, or biochemistry
    are particularly encouraged to investigate the Franck lab
    further.
