  abstract  = {This paper describes the design, construction and use of a field-cycled proton-electron double-resonance imaging (FC-PEDRI) system for the detection and imaging of free radicals. The unique feature of this imager is its use of a 450-mT detection magnetic field in order to achieve good image quality and sensitivity. The detection magnetic field is provided by a superconducting magnet, giving high stability and homogeneity. Field cycling is implemented by switching on and off the current in an internal, coaxial, resistive secondary magnet that partially cancels the superconducting magnet's field at the sample; the secondary magnet is actively shielded to avoid eddy currents. EPR irradiation takes place at ∼5 mT, following which the field is switched to 450 mT in 40 ms for NMR signal detection. Full details of the imager's subsystems are given, and experiments to image the distribution of stable free radical contrast agents in phantoms and in anesthetized rats are described. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {A four-pulse version of the pulse double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiment is presented, which is designed for the determination of interradical distances on a nanoscopic length-scale. With the new pulse sequence electron-electron couplings can be studied without dead-time artifacts, so that even broad distributions of electron-electron distances can be characterized. A version of the experiment that uses a pulse train in the detection period exhibits improved signal-to-noise ratio. Tests on two nitroxide biradicals with known length indicate that the accessible range of distances extends from about 1.5 to 8 nm. The four-pulse DEER spectra of an ionic spin probe in an ionomer exhibit features due to probe molecules situated both on the same and on different ion clusters. The former feature provides information on the cluster size and is inaccessible with previous methods.},

  abstract = {Stochastic excitation with a full-width-half-maximum bandwidth of 250 MHz was used to perform Fourier-transform (FT) high-field/high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 3.4T/95 GHz (W-band). Thereby, the required microwave peak power is reduced by a factor of tau(p)/T1 as compared to equivalent pulsed FT EPR in which the spin system with spin-lattice relaxation time T1 is excited by a single microwave pulse of length tau(p). Stochastic EPR is particularly interesting under high-field/high-frequency conditions, because the limited output power of mm microwave sources, amplifiers, and mixers makes pulse FT EPR in that frequency domain impossible, at least for the near future. On the other hand, FT spectroscopy offers several advantages compared to field-swept magnetic resonance methods, as is demonstrated by its success in NMR and X-band EPR. In this paper we describe a novel stochastic W-band microwave bridge including a bimodal induction mode transmission resonator that serves for decoupling the microwave excitation and signal detection. We report first EPR measurements and discuss experimental difficulties as well as achieved sensitivity. Moreover, we discuss future improvements and the possibility for an application of stochastic W-band FT EPR to transient signals such as those of photoexcited radical pairs in photosynthetic reaction centers.},

A commercial waveform generator was integrated with the transmit arm of the existing time-domain RF-EPR spectrometer to generate tailored excitation pulses with sub-nano second resolution for excitation with a 90 degrees flip-angle. A truncated sinc [sin(x)/x] pulse, tailored to compensate for the Q-profile (RF frequency response) of the resonator, was shown to yield images from phantom objects as well as in vivo images, with minimal distortion. These studies point to the advantages in using shaped sinc pulses to achieve improved uniform excitation over a relatively wide bandwidth region in time-domain RF-EPR imaging (RF-FT-EPRI).},

  abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy provides a variety of tools to study structures and structural changes of large biomolecules or complexes thereof. In order to unravel secondary structure elements, domain arrangements or complex formation, continuous wave and pulsed EPR methods capable of measuring the magnetic dipole coupling between two unpaired electrons can be used to obtain long-range distance constraints on the nanometer scale. Such methods yield reliably and precisely distances of up to 80 A, can be applied to biomolecules in aqueous buffer solutions or membranes, and are not size limited. They can be applied either at cryogenic or physiological temperatures and down to amounts of a few nanomoles. Spin centers may be metal ions, metal clusters, cofactor radicals, amino acid radicals, or spin labels. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the different EPR spectroscopic methods, briefly describe their theoretical background, and summarize important biological applications. The main focus of this article will be on pulsed EPR methods like pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) and their applications to spin-labeled biosystems.},

  abstract = {Short-pulse saturation recovery electron spin resonance methods have been used to measure lateral diffusion of nitroxide-labeled lipids in multilamellar liposomal dispersions. Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used. Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials. The time constants contain various combinations of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) for both isotopes, Heisenberg exchange rates, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times (T1n). Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants. The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that (i) the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number, (ii) relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition, (iii) the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length, (iv) T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration, and (v) Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration. It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here. The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spin-lattice relaxation probabilities.},

(a) The development of two-dimensional Fourier transform (FT) ESR required spectrometers providing intense pi/2 microwave pulses of very short (3-5 ns) duration, wide bandwidths, and very short dead times. It has enabled studies that resolve sophisticated details of molecular dynamics in complex fluids. (b) Methods that produce multiple quantum coherences by pulsed ESR now enable accurate measurements of large distances ({\textgreater}12A). (c) One of the most important advances has been the extension of ESR to high magnetic fields and high frequencies. This has benefited from the utilization of quasi-optical methods, especially above 150 GHz. The greatly improved orientational resolution and the faster "snapshot" of motions that are provided by ESR at high frequencies enhance studies of molecular dynamics. The use of both high and lower frequencies enables one to unravel faster and slower modes from the complex dynamics of fluids and macromolecules. (d) The development of FT-ESR imaging required substantial pulsed field gradients lasting only 50-100 ns. ESR imaging is effective in studying diffusion in fluids. Areas for further development are also described.},

  abstract = {Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is the method of choice to study paramagnetic cofactors that often play an important role as active centers in electron transfer processes in biological systems. However, in many cases more than one paramagnetic species is contributing to the observed EPR spectrum, making the analysis of individual contributions difficult and in some cases impossible. With time-domain techniques it is possible to exploit differences in the relaxation behavior of different paramagnetic species to distinguish between them and separate their individual spectral contribution. Here we give an overview of the use of pulsed EPR spectroscopy to study the iron-sulfur clusters of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). While FeS cluster N1 can be studied individually at a temperature of 30 K, this is not possible for FeS cluster N2 due to its severe spectral overlap with cluster N1. In this case Relaxation Filtered Hyperfine (REFINE) spectroscopy can be used to separate the overlapping spectra based on differences in their relaxation behavior.},

  abstract = {The function of many proteins involves equilibria between conformational substates, and to elucidate mechanisms of function it is essential to have experimental tools to detect the presence of conformational substates and to determine the time scale of exchange between them. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) has the potential to serve this purpose. In proteins containing a nitroxide side chain (R1), multicomponent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra can arise either from equilibria involving different conformational substates or rotamers of R1. To employ SDSL to uniquely identify conformational equilibria, it is thus essential to distinguish between these origins of multicomponent spectra. Here we show that this is possible based on the time scale for exchange of the nitroxide between distinct environments that give rise to multicomponent EPR spectra; rotamer exchange for R1 lies in the ≈0.1-1 $\mu$s range, while conformational exchange is at least an order of magnitude slower. The time scales of exchange events are determined by saturation recovery EPR, and in favorable cases, the exchange rate constants between substates with lifetimes of approximately 1-70 $\mu$s can be estimated by the approach.},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional Fourier Transform ESR (2D FT ESR) spectrometer operating at 9.25 and 17.35 GHz is described. The Ku-band bridge uses an efficient heterodyne technique wherein 9.25 GHz is the intermediate frequency. At Ku-band the sensitivity is increased by almost an order of magnitude. One may routinely collect a full 2D ELDOR spectrum in less than 20 min for a sample containing 0.5-5 nmol of nitroxide spin-probe in the slow-motional regime. Broad spectral coverage at Ku-band is obtained by use of a bridged loop-gap resonator (BLGR) and of a dielectric ring resonator (DR). It is shown that an even more uniform spectral excitation is obtained by using shorter microwave pulses of about 3 ns duration. The dead-time at Ku-band is just 30-40 ns, yielding an improved SNR in 2D ELDOR spectra of nitroxide spin-probes with T2 as short as 20-30 ns. A comparison of 2D ELDOR spectra obtained at 9.25 and 17. 35 GHz for spin-labeled phospholipid probes (16PC) in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) membrane vesicles showed that both spectra could be satisfactorily simulated using the same set of model parameters even though they are markedly different in appearance. The improved sensitivity and shorter dead-time at Ku-band made it possible to obtain orientation-dependent 2D ELDOR spectra of the Cholestane (CSL) spin-probe in macroscopically aligned lipid bilayers of egg yolk PC using samples containing only 1 mg of lipid and just 5 nmol of spin-probe.},

  abstract  = {The first two-dimensional Fourier-transform electron spin resonance (2D-FT-ESR) studies of nitroxide-labeled lipids in membrane vesicles are reported. The considerable enhancement this experiment provides for extracting rotational and translational diffusion rates, as well as orientational ordering parameters by means of ESR spectroscopy, is demonstrated. The 2D spectral analysis is achieved using theoretical simulations that are fit to experiments by an efficient and automated nonlinear least squares approach. These methods are applied to dispersions of 1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (POPC) model membranes utilizing spin labels 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidylcholine and the 3-doxyl derivative of cholestan-3-one (CSL). Generally favorable agreement is obtained between the results obtained by 2D-FT-ESR on vesicles with the previous results on similar systems studied by continuous wave (cw) ESR on aligned samples. The precision in determining the dynamic and ordering parameters is significantly better for 2D-FT-ESR, even though the cw ESR spectra from membrane vesicles are resolved more poorly than those from well aligned samples. Some small differences in results by the two methods are discussed in terms of limitations of the methods and/or theoretical models, as well as possible differences between dynamic molecular structure in vesicles versus aligned membranes. An interesting observation with CSL/POPC, that the apparent homogeneous linewidths seem to increase in "real time," is tentatively attributed to the effects of slow director fluctuations in the membrane vesicles.},

A truncated sinc [sin(x)/x] pulse, tailored to compensate for the Q-profile (RF frequency response) of the resonator, was shown to yield images from phantom objects as well as in vivo images, with minimal distortion.

  abstract = {There are no easily obtainable EPR spectral parameters for lipid spin labels that describe profiles of membrane fluidity. The order parameter, which is most often used as a measure of membrane fluidity, describes the amplitude of wobbling motion of alkyl chains relative to the membrane normal and does not contain explicitly time or velocity. Thus, this parameter can be considered as nondynamic. The spin-lattice relaxation rate (T(1)(-1)) obtained from saturation-recovery EPR measurements of lipid spin labels in deoxygenated samples depends primarily on the rotational correlation time of the nitroxide moiety within the lipid bilayer. Thus, T(1)(-1) can be used as a convenient quantitative measure of membrane fluidity that reflects local membrane dynamics. T(1)(-1) profiles obtained for 1-palmitoyl-2-(n-doxylstearoyl)phosphatidylcholine (n-PC) spin labels in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membranes with and without 50 mol{\%} cholesterol are presented in parallel with profiles of the rotational diffusion coefficient, R(⊥), obtained from simulation of EPR spectra using Freed's model. These profiles are compared with profiles of the order parameter obtained directly from EPR spectra and with profiles of the order parameter obtained from simulation of EPR spectra. It is shown that T(1)(-1) and R(⊥) profiles reveal changes in membrane fluidity that depend on the motional properties of the lipid alkyl chain. We find that cholesterol has a rigidifying effect only to the depth occupied by the rigid steroid ring structure and a fluidizing effect at deeper locations. These effects cannot be differentiated by profiles of the order parameter. All profiles in this study were obtained at X-band (9.5 GHz).},

As previously shown with power saturation methods, such exchange rates are direct measures of the solvent accessibility of the nitroxide side chains in the protein structure. The periodic dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rates and the exchange rates along the 128-135 sequence reveal the presence of the helical structure, demonstrating the use of these parameters in structure determination. In general, multiple exponentials are required to fit the saturation recovery data, thus identifying multiple states of the side chain. In one case, multiple conformations detected in the spectrum are not evident in the saturation recovery, suggesting rapid exchange on the timescale of spin-lattice relaxation.},

  abstract = {Saturation-recovery (SR) EPR at W-band (94 GHz) to obtain profiles of the membrane fluidity and profiles of the oxygen transport parameter is demonstrated for lens lipid membranes using phosphatidylcholine (n-PC), stearic acid (n-SASL), and cholesterol analog (ASL and CSL) spin labels, and compared with results obtained in parallel experiments at X-band (9.4 GHz). Membranes were derived from the total lipids extracted from 2-year-old porcine lens cortex and nucleus. Two findings are especially significant. First, measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation times T1 for n-PCs allowed T1 profiles across the membrane to be obtained. These profiles reflect local membrane properties differently than profiles of the order parameter. Profiles obtained at W-band are, however, shifted to longer T1 values compared to those obtained at X-band. Second, using cholesterol analog spin labels and relaxation agents (hydrophobic oxygen and water-soluble NiEDDA), the cholesterol bilayer domain was discriminated in membranes made from lipids of the lens nucleus. However, membranes made from cortical lipids show a single homogeneous environment. Profiles of the oxygen transport parameter obtained from W-band measurements are practically identical to those obtained from X-band measurements, and are very similar to those obtained earlier at X-band for membranes made of 2-year-old bovine cortical and nuclear lens lipids (M. Raguz, J. Widomska, J. Dillon, E.R. Gaillard, W.K. Subczynski, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1788 (2009) 2380-2388). Results demonstrate that SR EPR at W-band has the potential to be a powerful tool for studying samples of small volume, ∼30 nL, compared with the sample volume of ∼3 $\mu$L at X-band.},

Results obtained in DRCOSY experiments show that the diffusion process of dextran 77 kDa exhibits an observation time dependence suggesting a diffusion behavior restricted by confinement. We find evidence for both single capsule and capsule aggregate states, with a partitioning of the 77-kDa dextran between the free and capsule states much larger than that suggested by volume fraction alone. Results from DEXSY experiments show that dextran 77 kDa is in diffusive exchange through the capsules with an exchange time of around 1 s. In contrast, the capsules have no detectable influence on the diffusion process of the dextran 4.4 kDa. This quantitative information may be used in designing PEM capsules as drug carriers.},

Moreover, the fate of the injected liposomal preparations was examined, as well as the possibility to achieve a depot effect. METHODS: Highly concentrated solutions of the spin probe 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-trimethylammoniumpiperidine-1-oxyl-iodide (CAT-1; 138 mM) were encapsulated in liposomes. They were characterized by laser diffraction, and the liberation of spin probe was investigated by ESR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Line shape changes allowed the differentiation between encapsulated and released CAT-1 after subcutaneous injection of liposomes. Multilamellar liposomes form a local depot at the site of injection. A sustained release of the spin probe from the depot was monitored by means of ESR. Whereas 40{\%} of the spin probe was released within the first 96 h after administration, 60{\%} remained in intact liposomes under the skin. No depot formation could be observed after injection of CAT-1 solutions, but a fast signal decrease due to systemic distribution and bioreduction of the nitroxide spin probe. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive analysis of liposomal integrity in living animals was successfully accomplished using a new L-Band ESR spectroscopy method. The liberation of CAT-1 from liposomes in vitro and in vivo was monitored by changes in the lineshape of ESR spectra and Heisenberg spin exchange. The significance of liposomal integrity for the formation of a localized drug depot effect was proved.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The influence of liposome composition on the bilayer fluidity and on the transport of encapsulated substance into the skin was investigated. METHODS: Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) with various amounts of cholesterol were prepared by the film method and characterised by photon correlation spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. The transport of the hydrophilic spin probe encapsulated in MLV into pig ear skin was investigated by EPR imaging methods. The bilayer domain structure was studied by fitting the lineshape of the experimental EPR spectra with the spectra calculated by the model, which takes into account the heterogeneous structure of the bilayer with several coexisting domains. RESULTS: Cholesterol strongly influences the entrapped volume of liposomes, the domain structure of the lipid bilayer, and the transport of hydrophilic spin probe into the skin. Transport was not observed for liposomes composed of phospholipid:cholesterol 1:0 or 9:1 (mol:mol), not even above the phase transition temperature from the gel to the liquid crystalline phase of DMPC. A significant delivery of hydrophilic spin probe was observed only if there was 30 or 50 mol{\%} of cholesterol in the liposome bilayer. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the domain structure of the liposome bilayer is more important for the delivery of encapsulated substance into the skin than the liquid crystalline phase of the pure phospholipids bilayer.},

Phantoms were prepared with a CAT-1 solution and a liposomal CAT-1 suspension. Spectral-spatial images were obtained along several polar-arranged spatial axes through the phantom. The 1D spatial distributions (projections) of each signal component, reflecting the concentration of CAT-1, were then extracted from the spectral-spatial images. 2D EPR images of liposomal-encapsulated CAT-1 and free CAT-1 were separately reconstructed from the resulting projection data sets. 2D mapping of each component exhibited good agreement with respect to the phantom. Separate maps were generated from separate injections of free CAT-1 and liposomal CAT-1 injected into the femoral muscle of a living mouse. The EPR signal of the free CAT-1 gradually decreased during data acquisition. Because of this decay, we calibrated the image intensity by extrapolating the signal intensity to that detected at the beginning of data sampling. Both the position and size of the individual images were in very good agreement with those of the mouse thigh obtained by MRI.},

abstract = {Water-soluble spin labels were used to study dimyristoyllecithin (DML) phospholipid multilayers. Previous studies report that there is a "bound" water region associated with dimyristoyllecithin containing about 10 molecules of water per phospholipid, a "trapped" water region located between the lamellae containing approximately 11 molecules per phospholipid, and a "ftion show that certain water-soluble spin-label mol-cules have their motional properties differentially modified by these three water environements. Furthermore, the labels also reveal the onset of lipid-phase transitions even though they have high water solubility. A phosphate-containing spin label demonstrated strong an isotropic motion in the lipid-water system above the phase transition but not below. The addition of cholesterol to the DML-water system removed the anisotropic motion of 2,2,6,6-tetramehtyl-4-phosphopiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempophosphate) and obscured the detection bound, trapped, and free water. In addition to the change-charge interactions between Tempophosphate and DML, two other spin labels were used both in the charged and uncharged states. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempamine) in the charged state showed extremely strong anisotropic motion, presumably due to the interaction between the charged amine and the phosphate group of DML. When only partially charged, Tempamine showed much less anisotropic motion. PCA was analyzed at pH values where the carboxyl group was protonated and unprotonated. The resulting interaction was different at the two pH values. These water-soluble spin labels mimic ionic or nonionic solutes. Upon freezing, the spin labels are shown to be expelled from the ice regions into the remaining aqueous regions. The usefulness of this approach in studying solute behavior when freezing occurs and potential studies involving aqueous regions of cytoplasm are considered.},

  abstract = {Biological water at the interface of proteins is critical to their equilibrium structures and enzyme function and to phenomena such as molecular recognition and protein-protein interactions. To actually probe the dynamics of water structure at the surface, we must examine the protein itself, without disrupting the native structure, and the ultrafast elementary processes of hydration. Here we report direct study, with femtosecond resolution, of the dynamics of hydration at the surface of the enzyme protein Subtilisin Carlsberg, whose single Trp residue (Trp-113) was used as an intrinsic biological fluorescent probe. For the protein, we observed two well separated dynamical solvation times, 0.8 ps and 38 ps, whereas in bulk water, we obtained 180 fs and 1.1 ps. We also studied a covalently bonded probe at a separation of approximately 7 A and observed the near disappearance of the 38-ps component, with solvation being practically complete in (time constant) 1.5 ps. The degree of rigidity of the probe (anisotropy decay) and of the water environment (protein vs. micelle) was also studied. These results show that hydration at the surface is a dynamical process with two general types of trajectories, those that result from weak interactions with the selected surface site, giving rise to bulk-type solvation (approximately 1 ps), and those that have a stronger interaction, enough to define a rigid water structure, with a solvation time of 38 ps, much slower than that of the bulk. At a distance of approximately 7 A from the surface, essentially all trajectories are bulk-type. The theoretical framework for these observations is discussed.},

  abstract = {There are a number of methods that can be used for the preparation of enzyme-containing lipid vesicles (liposomes) which are lipid dispersions that contain water-soluble enzymes in the trapped aqueous space. This has been shown by many investigations carried out with a variety of enzymes. A review of these studies is given and some of the main results are summarized. With respect to the vesicle-forming amphiphiles used, most preparations are based on phosphatidylcholine, either the natural mixtures obtained from soybean or egg yolk, or chemically defined compounds, such as DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) or POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). Charged enzyme-containing lipid vesicles are often prepared by adding a certain amount of a negatively charged amphiphile (typically dicetylphosphate) or a positively charged lipid (usually stearylamine). The presence of charges in the vesicle membrane may lead to an adsorption of the enzyme onto the interior or exterior site of the vesicle bilayers. If (i) the high enzyme encapsulation efficiencies; (ii) avoidance of the use of organic solvents during the entrapment procedure; (iii) relatively monodisperse spherical vesicles of about 100 nm diameter; and (iv) a high degree of unilamellarity are required, then the use of the so-called 'dehydration-rehydration method', followed by the 'extrusion technique' has shown to be superior over other procedures. In addition to many investigations in the field of cheese production--there are several studies on the (potential) medical and biomedical applications of enzyme-containing lipid vesicles (e.g. in the enzyme-replacement therapy or for immunoassays)--including a few in vivo studies. In many cases, the enzyme molecules are expected to be released from the vesicles at the target site, and the vesicles in these cases serve as the carrier system. For (potential) medical applications as enzyme carriers in the blood circulation, the preparation of sterically stabilized lipid vesicles has proven to be advantageous. Regarding the use of enzyme-containing vesicles as submicrometer-sized nanoreactors, substrates are added to the bulk phase. Upon permeation across the vesicle bilayer(s), the trapped enzymes inside the vesicles catalyze the conversion of the substrate molecules into products. Using physical (e.g. microwave irradiation) or chemical methods (e.g. addition of micelle-forming amphiphiles at sublytic concentration), the bilayer permeability can be controlled to a certain extent. A detailed molecular understanding of these (usually) submicrometer-sized bioreactor systems is still not there. There are only a few approaches towards a deeper understanding and modeling of the catalytic activity of the entrapped enzyme molecules upon externally added substrates. Using micrometer-sized vesicles (so-called 'giant vesicles') as simple models for the lipidic matrix of biological cells, enzyme molecules can be microinjected inside individual target vesicles, and the corresponding enzymatic reaction can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy using appropriate fluorogenic substrate molecules.},

  abstract = {Short-pulse saturation recovery electron spin resonance methods have been used to measure lateral diffusion of nitroxide-labeled lipids in multilamellar liposomal dispersions. Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used. Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials. The time constants contain various combinations of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) for both isotopes, Heisenberg exchange rates, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times (T1n). Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants. The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that (i) the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number, (ii) relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition, (iii) the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length, (iv) T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration, and (v) Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration. It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here. The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spin-lattice relaxation probabilities.},

  abstract = {A new approach has been developed to probe the structural properties of membrane peptides and proteins using the pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance technique of electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy and the $\alpha$-helical M2$\delta$ subunit of the acetylcholine receptor incorporated into phospholipid bicelles. To demonstrate the practicality of this method, a cysteine-mutated nitroxide spin label (SL) is positioned 1, 2, 3, and 4 residues away from a fully deuterated Val side chain (denoted i + 1 to i + 4). The characteristic periodicity of the $\alpha$-helical structure gives rise to a unique pattern in the ESEEM spectra. In the i + 1 and i + 2 samples, the ²H nuclei are too far away to be detected. However, with the 3.6 residue per turn pattern of an $\alpha$-helix, the i + 3 and i + 4 samples reveal a strong signal from the ²H nuclei of the Val side chain. Modeling studies verify these data suggesting that the closest ²H-labeled Val to SL distance would in fact be expected in the i + 3 and i + 4 samples. This technique is very advantageous, because it provides pertinent qualitative structural information on an inherently difficult system like membrane proteins in a short period of time (minutes) with small amounts of protein ($\mu$g).},

To simultaneously model these two types of behavior, we refined an orientation dependent model of hydrogen bonds [Kortemme et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2003, 326, 1239] used by the molecular modeling program Rosetta and then combined it with a distance-dependent Coulomb model of electrostatics. The functional form of the H-bond potential is physically motivated and parameters are fit so that H-bond geometries that Rosetta generates closely resemble H-bond geometries in high-resolution crystal structures. The combined potentials improve performance in a variety of scientific benchmarks including decoy discrimination, side chain prediction, and native sequence recovery in protein design simulations and establishes a new standard energy function for Rosetta.},

The experimental observations are nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) between protons of individual amino acid residues of the protein and those of hydration water. These NOEs were recorded by two-dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) in the laboratory frame, and by the corresponding experiments in the rotating frame (ROESY). The studies show that there are two qualitatively different types of hydration sites. Four water molecules in the interior of the BPTI molecule are in identical locations in the crystal structure and in solution. Their NOEs with the protein protons are characterized by large negative cross-relaxation rates sigma NOE, which indicates that the residence times of the water molecules in these hydration sites are longer than ca. 10 ns. Additional experiments with extrinsic shift reagents established an upper limit of 20 ms at 4 degrees C for these residence times. Surface hydration of both the globular protein BPTI and the flexibly disordered polypeptide oxytocin is by water molecules with residence times in the subnanosecond range, as evidenced by small positive sigma NOE values observed for their NOEs with nearby polypeptide protons. Short residence times prevail for all surface hydration sites, independent of whether or not they are occupied by well ordered, X-ray observable water in the protein single crystals.},

The biophysical structural evidence was at {\AA}ngstrom-level resolution under solution conditions not amenable to crystallography or NMR. In the absence of complementary TAR RNA, double labels located in both the upper and the lower stem of mini TAR DNA showed in the presence of NCp7 a broadened distance distribution between the points of attachment, and there was evidence for several conformers. Next, when equimolar amounts of mini TAR DNA and complementary mini TAR RNA were present, NCp7 enhanced the annealing of their stem-loop structures to form duplex DNA-RNA. When duplex TAR DNA-TAR RNA formed, double labels initially located 27.5 {\AA} apart at the 3'- and 5'-termini of the 27-base mini TAR DNA relocated to opposite ends of a 27 bp RNA-DNA duplex with 76.5 {\AA} between labels, a distance which was consistent with the distance between the two labels in a thermally annealed 27-bp TAR DNA-TAR RNA duplex. Different sets of double labels initially located 26-27 {\AA} apart in the mini TAR DNA upper stem, appropriately altered their interlabel distance to ∼35 {\AA} when a 27 bp TAR DNA-TAR RNA duplex formed, where the formation was caused either through NCp7-induced annealing or by thermal annealing. In summary, clear structural evidence was obtained for the fraying and destabilization brought on by NCp7 in its biochemical function as an annealing agent and for the detailed structural change from stem-loop to duplex RNA-DNA when complementary RNA was present.},

In particular, we present a detailed analysis of three time constants: (1) the longitudinal build-up time constant TB for (1)H; (2) the rotating frame relaxation time constant T1$\rho$ for (1)H and (13)C and (3) T2 of (13)C, the transverse relaxation time constant in the laboratory frame. These relaxation times were measured during microwave irradiation at a magnetic field of 5 T (140 GHz) as a function of the concentration of four polarizing agents: TOTAPOL, 4-amino-TEMPO, trityl (OX063), and Gd-DOTA and are compared to those obtained for a sample lacking paramagnetic doping. We also report the EPR relaxation time constants T1S and T2S, the DNP enhancements, $\epsilon$, and the parameter E, defined below, which measures the sensitivity enhancement for the four polarizing agents as a function of the electron concentration. We observe substantial intensity losses (paramagnetic quenching) with all of the polarizing agents due to broadening mechanisms and cross relaxation during MAS. In particular, the monoradical trityl and biradical TOTAPOL induce ∼40{\%} and 50{\%} loss of signal intensity. In contrast there is little suppression of signal intensity in static samples containing these paramagnetic species. Despite the losses due to quenching, we find that all of the polarizing agents provide substantial gains in signal intensity with DNP, and in particular that the net enhancement is optimal for biradicals that operate with the cross effect. We discuss the possibility that much of this polarization loss can be regained with the development of instrumentation and methods to perform electron decoupling.},

abstract = {The physical properties of DNA are quite important for molecular genetics as well as for its nanotechnological applications. Studying the interactions of alternating current (AC) electric fields with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) allows one to draw conclusions about these properties. These interactions are usually investigated in two different ways. In dielectric spectroscopy, a DNA solution is placed in a homogeneous AC field and electronic parameters are measured over several frequency decades in the Hz to GHz range. These electronic data are then interpreted on the basis of physico-chemical models as a result of certain phenomena on the molecular level. In dielectrophoretic studies, a DNA solution is exposed to an inhomogeneous AC field and the spatial response of few or single molecules is monitored by optical or scanning force microscopy. This response can involve translation, elongation and orientation of the molecular strings.

  abstract  = {Denoising multidimensional NMR-spectra is a fundamental step in NMR protein structure determination. The state-of-the-art method uses wavelet-denoising, which may suffer when applied to non-stationary signals affected by Gaussian-white-noise mixed with strong impulsive artifacts, like those in multi-dimensional NMR-spectra. Regrettably, Wavelet's performance depends on a combinatorial search of wavelet shapes and parameters; and multi-dimensional extension of wavelet-denoising is highly non-trivial, which hampers its application to multidimensional NMR-spectra. Here, we endorse a diverse philosophy of denoising NMR-spectra: less is more! We consider spatial filters that have only one parameter to tune: the window-size. We propose, for the first time, the 3D extension of the median-modified-Wiener-filter (MMWF), an adaptive variant of the median-filter, and also its novel variation named MMWF*. We test the proposed filters and the Wiener-filter, an adaptive variant of the mean-filter, on a benchmark set that contains 16 two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR-spectra extracted from eight proteins. Our results demonstrate that the adaptive spatial filters significantly outperform their non-adaptive versions. The performance of the new MMWF* on 2D/3D-spectra is even better than wavelet-denoising. Noticeably, MMWF* produces stable high performance almost invariant for diverse window-size settings: this signifies a consistent advantage in the implementation of automatic pipelines for protein NMR-spectra analysis.},

Additionally, the applicability of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which leads to sensitivity enhancements of 2 orders of magnitude, to 17O is wrought with challenges due to the lack of spin diffusion and low polarization transfer efficiency from 1H. Here, we demonstrate new DNP-based measurements that extend 17O solid-state NMR beyond its current capabilities. The use of the PRESTO technique instead of conventional 1H$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}17O cross-polarization greatly improves the sensitivity and enables the facile measurement of undistorted line shapes and two-dimensional 1H$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}17O HETCOR NMR spectra as well as accurate internuclear distance measurements at natural abundance. This was applied for distinguishing hydrogen-bonded and lone 17O sites on the surface of silica gel; the one-dimensional spectrum of which could not be used to extract such detail. Lastly, this greatly enhanced sensitivity has enabled, for the first time, the detection of surface hydroxyl sites on mesoporous silica at natural abundance, thereby extending the concept of DNP surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy to the 17O nuclide.},

  abstract  = {Interfacial waters are considered to play a crucial role in protein–protein interactions, but in what sense and why are they important? Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and statistical thermodynamic analyses, we demonstrate distinctive dynamic characteristics of the interfacial water and investigate their implications for the binding thermodynamics. We identify the presence of extraordinarily slow ({\~{}}1,000 times slower than in bulk water) hydrogen-bond rearrangements in interfacial water. We rationalize the slow rearrangements by introducing the " trapping " free energies, characterizing how strongly individual hydration waters are captured by the biomolecular surface, whose magnitude is then traced back to the number of water–protein hydrogen bonds and the strong electrostatic field produced at the binding interface. We also discuss the impact of the slow interfacial waters on the binding thermodynamics. We find that, as expected from their slow dynamics, the conventional approach to the water-mediated interaction, which assumes rapid equilibration of the waters' degrees of freedom, is inadequate. We show instead that an explicit treatment of the extremely slow interfacial waters is critical. Our results shed new light on the role of water in protein– protein interactions, highlighting the need to consider its dynamics to improve our understanding of biomolecular bindings. Water is an active and indispensable component of cells. Understanding its versatile roles in determining the structure and dynamics of biomolecules and mediating their interactions is of fundamental importance 1–3 . The versatility of water in biological contexts arises from its ability to alter its characteristics depending on its inter-action with biomolecules. For example, the DNA sequence-dependent behavior of hydration water serves as a sequence-specific " hydration fingerprint " 4 ; changes in water dynamics during binding of a substrate to an enzyme play a vital role in protein–ligand recognition 5 ; and the non-bulk behavior of water inside the translocon strongly affects the partitioning of hydrophobic segments from the translocon to the membrane 6 . However, although our understanding of the behavior of hydration water around biomolecules has advanced significantly in recent years 7–14 , it remains a challenge to elucidate the extent to which water molecules located between two biomol-ecules are modified through concurrent interactions with the two binding surfaces and how such altered water molecules in turn affect the binding affinity. In this connection, it has been suggested that water-mediated contacts substantially complement direct pro-tein–protein contacts, providing an additional layer of biomolecular recognition 15, 16},

It is found that the classical Fick's law description provides a surprisingly accurate prediction for the general behaviors of self-diffusion even for pore size of a few molecular diameters. The diffusion coefficient in the axial direction is reduced relative to bulk fluids for pore size less than about ten molecular diameters. In the radial direction, the mean-square displacement accurately follows Fick's law prediction, but with an average diffusion coefficient slightly lower than the bulk value. The origin of the diffusion behaviors is traced to the molecular motion in the restricted geometry of the cylindrical pores.},

  abstract = {The molecular dynamics of spin-labeled compounds included into the solid phase of cyclodextrins (CDs) has been studied using conventional (X-band) ESR at 9 GHz and high-field high-frequency (HFHF) ESR at 240 and 170 GHz. The patterns of axial rotation at these higher frequencies are clear just by inspection of the spectrum, unlike the case for 9 GHz spectra. That is HFHF ESR is sensitive to molecular motion about the diffusion axis collinear with the X, Y or Z-direction of the magnetic g- and A-tensors of the nitroxide moiety (referred to, respectively, as X, Y or Z-rotation). For doxyl stearic acids (Z-rotation) and TEMPOyl caprylate (X-rotation) included in beta- and gamma-CDs we were able to determine the rate of molecular motion and the corresponding potential barriers. We emphasize that determining the rate of Z-rotation by ESR is feasible only using HFHF ESR. For the X-rotation case we suggest that the motion of the nitroxide moiety consists of fast small-angle librations about the magnetic X-axis superimposed by rotational diffusion about the same axis. The potential barrier of 1.7 Kcal mol(-1) for this rotational diffusion is unusually low. A fascinating feature of TEMPO derivatives included in beta-CD is the detectable molecular motion at temperatures below 77 K. For the other CD-spin probe systems, we used multifrequency analysis to assign the conformations of spin-labeled molecules. A dramatic spectral change for 16-sasl in beta- and gamma-CDs at approximately 260 K corresponds to a tilting of the position of the nitroxide moiety on the rotating molecule relative to the long diffusion axis, while for TEMPO derivatives in gamma-cyclodextrin below 200 K, we observe a rapid transition from fast to very slow rotational motion. More complex features are best studied by means of multifrequency ESR experiments. The visual clarity and the simplicity of analysis of the ESR spectra shown in this work should provide a benchmark for future studies of molecular motion by HFHF ESR.},

After having recalled the theoretical basis of a three-spin system comprising, two nuclei-the water proton of the solvent, the dissolved Li+ ion and the free electron of a free radical-we have developed a transient solution in order to optimize potential biological applications of Li DNP. The three-spin model has allowed computation of all the parameters of the system-the longitudinal relaxation rate per unit of free radical concentration, the dipolar and scalar part of the coupling between the nuclei and the electron, and the maximum signal enhancement achievable for both proton and lithium spins.

abstract = {The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) constitute hetero-oligomeric machines that catalyze multiple topologically similar membrane-remodeling processes. Although ESCRT-III subunits polymerize into spirals, how individual ESCRT-III subunits are activated and assembled together into a membrane-deforming filament remains unknown. Here, we determine X-ray crystal structures of the most abundant ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 in its active conformation. Using pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy (PDS), we show that Snf7 activation requires a prominent conformational rearrangement to expose protein-membrane and protein-protein interfaces. This promotes the assembly of Snf7 arrays with {\~{}}30 {\AA} periodicity into a membrane-sculpting filament. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, both in vitro and in vivo , we demonstrate that mutations on these protein interfaces halt Snf7 assembly and block ESCRT function. The architecture of the activated and membrane-bound Snf7 polymer provides crucial insights into the spatially unique ESCRT-III-mediated membrane remodeling.},

Analyzing these experiments requires advanced computational tools for assigning regions in the resulting multi-dimensional correlation plots to specific secondary-structure elements and their couplings. A differential sensitivity analysis technique based on a perturbation of the local (real space) Hamiltonian is developed to achieve that goal. Application to the amide I region of a small globular protein reveals regions associated with the alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and their coupling. Comparison of signals generated in different directions shows that the double-quantum-coherence signal has a higher sensitivity to the couplings compared with the single-quantum-coherence (photon echo) technique.},

  abstract  = {A relatively simple method is developed whereby the many‐body features of a typical generalized Fokker–Planck equation (GFPE) for a diffusing molecule are first replaced by stochastic bath variables that are assumed to be Markovian. Then the combined molecular and bath variables are characterized as a multidimensional Markov process obeying a stochastic–Liouville equation, which is, in general, incomplete, because it ignores the back reaction of the molecule on the bath variables. In the final step, the equation is completed by subjecting it to the appropriate constraints required for detailed balance. In this form the augmented Fokker–Planck equation (AFPE) properly describes relaxation to thermal equilibrium, and, for the appropriate limiting conditions, it reduces to the classical Fokker–Planck equation. This procedure for stochastic modeling of GFPE is both an improvement on and a generalization of a method previously outlined by Hwang, Mason, Hwang, and Freed (HMHF). Detailed illustrations of AFPE's are presented for the simple case of a planar rotator subjected to fluctuating torques, and these models are extended to the case of three‐dimensional rotational diffusion. Examples include fluctuatingtorque models related to that used by HMHF. It is shown that only if the fluctuatingtorque is independent of the orientation of the molecule (more precisely of any fluctuating equilibrium orientation of the molecule), does the model become equivalent to the usual generalized Langevin equation. Otherwise, more general nonlinear models are obtained, which, however, are easily handled by the present methods. Models related to the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) model of Polnaszek and Freed are also developed. They are shown to be a consequence of requiring relaxation to the instantaneous value of the fluctuating potential associated with the torque, whereas the fluctuatingtorque models are a consequence of requiring relaxation to a uniform orientational distribution. They differ further in that the SRLS models are ''nonfrictional''. For these reasons we characterize the fluctuating torques as being ''collision‐induced'' and the SRLS as being ''structure‐induced''.},

  abstract  = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) powered by a free electron laser (FEL) has been shown to dramatically expand the capabilities of EPR at frequencies above {\~{}}100 GHz, where other high-power sources are unavailable. High-power pulses are necessary to achieve fast ({\textless}10 ns) spin rotations in order to alleviate the limited excitation bandwidth and time resolution that typically hamper pulsed EPR at these high frequencies. While at these frequencies, an FEL is the only source that provides {\~{}}1 kW of power and can be tuned continuously up to frequencies above 1 THz, it has only recently been implemented for one- and two-pulse EPR, and the capabilities of the FEL as an EPR source are still being expanded. This manuscript presents phase cycling of two pulses in an FEL-EPR spectrometer operating at 240 GHz. Given that the FEL, unlike amplifiers, cannot be easily phase-locked to a reference source, we instead apply retrospective data processing to measure the relative phase of each FEL pulse in order to correct the signal phase accordingly. This allows the measured signal to be averaged coherently, and the randomly changing phase of the FEL pulse results in a stochastic phase cycle, which, in the limit of many pulses, efficiently cancels artifacts and improves sensitivity. Further, the relative phase between the first and second pulse, which originates from the difference in path length traversed by each pulse, can be experimentally measured without phase-sensitive detection. We show that the relative phase of the two pulses can be precisely tuned, as well as distinctly switched by a fixed amount, with the insertion of a dielectric material into the quasi-optical path of one of the pulses. Taken together, these techniques offer many of the advantages of arbitrary phase control, and allow application of phase cycling to dramatically enhance signal quality in pulsed EPR experiments utilizing high-power sources that cannot be phase-locked.},

  abstract  = {Infrared vibrational scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) has emerged as a new frontier in imaging science due to its potential to provide nanoscale spatially resolved chemical spectroscopy for the investigation of molecular, soft-matter, and biological materials. As a phase-sensitive technique able to yield the full complex dielectric function of materials, different interferometric schemes have been developed involving asymmetric interferometry between sample and reference arms. In this work, we take advantage of a greatly simplified symmetric geometry that uses the spatially coherent background scattered light from within the confocal sample volume as a reference field for signal amplification in both self-homodyne and self-heterodyne interferometry. On the basis of a simple model for tip-sample scattering and interferometric detection, we demonstrate the measurement of the vibrational response of molecular materials in good agreement with established values. In addition to a compact design, enhanced signal levels, and a reduced sensitivity to fluctuations and drift, including those from the light source, self-referenced interferometry brings benefits for routine s-SNOM chemical spectroscopy, remaining robust even under a wide range of challenging experimental environments.},

Recently, redox-active organic molecules in aqueous RFBs have drawn substantial attention due to their rapid kinetics and low membrane crossover rates. Drawing inspiration from nature, here we report a high-performance aqueous RFB utilizing an organic redox compound, alloxazine, which is a tautomer of the isoalloxazine backbone of vitamin B2. It can be synthesized in high yield at room temperature by single-step coupling of inexpensive o-phenylenediamine derivatives and alloxan. The highly alkaline-soluble alloxazine 7/8-carboxylic acid produces a RFB exhibiting open-circuit voltage approaching 1.2 V and current efficiency and capacity retention exceeding 99.7{\%} and 99.98{\%} per cycle, respectively. Theoretical studies indicate that structural modification of alloxazine with electron-donating groups should allow further increases in battery voltage. As an aza-aromatic molecule that undergoes reversible redox cycling in aqueous electrolyte, alloxazine represents a class of radical-free redox-active organics for use in large-scale energy storage.},

  abstract = {Incoherent quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) has been used to measure the dynamics of water molecules in solutions of a model protein backbone, N-acetyl-glycine-methylamide (NAGMA), as a function of concentration, for comparison with results for water dynamics in aqueous solutions of the N-acetyl-leucine-methylamide (NALMA) hydrophobic peptide at comparable concentrations. From the analysis of the elastic incoherent structure factor, we find significant fractions of elastic intensity at high and low concentrations for both solutes, which corresponds to a greater population of protons with rotational time scales outside the experimental resolution ({\textgreater}13 ps). The higher-concentration solutions show a component of the elastic fraction that we propose is due to water motions that are strongly coupled to the solute motions, while for low-concentration solutions an additional component is activated due to dynamic coupling between inner and outer hydration layers. An important difference between the solute types at the highest concentration studied is found from stretched exponential fits to their experimental intermediate scattering functions, showing more pronounced anomalous diffusion signatures for NALMA, including a smaller stretched exponent beta and a longer structural relaxation time tau than those found for NAGMA. The more normal water diffusion exhibited near the hydrophilic NAGMA provides experimental support for an explanation of the origin of the anomalous diffusion behavior of NALMA as arising from frustrated interactions between water molecules when a chemical interface is formed upon addition of a hydrophobic side chain, inducing spatial heterogeneity in the hydration dynamics in the two types of regions of the NALMA peptide. We place our QENS measurements on model biological solutes in the context of other spectroscopic techniques and provide both confirming as well as complementary dynamic information that attempts to give a unifying molecular view of hydration dynamics signatures near peptides and proteins.},

  abstract = {The residence time of water in the minor groove of the d(CGCGAATTCGCG) duplex has been determined by a recent measurement combining nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOE, ROE) and 17O relaxation dispersion. The time is in the range of nanoseconds, so that it may be measured by a rather simple method proposed here, namely the choice of conditions such that the NOE between the observed DNA proton and a nearby water proton is zero. This condition is realized when the residence time of the water molecule is 0.178 times the nuclear magnetic resonance period (e.g. 0.297 ns at 600 MHz). It may be achieved by varying the magnetic field and/or the temperature. The zero-NOE measurement may be performed by one-dimensional NMR, and has therefore good sensitivity. We have developed excitation sequences which suppress two spurious contributions to the NOE: from neighboring exchangeable protons and from H3' protons whose chemical shift is close to that of water. The method is applied here to the comparison of residence times of water next to B-DNA and next to B'-DNA, the latter corresponding to better stacked, propeller-twisted base-pairs and a correspondingly narrower minor groove. In the minor groove of [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2, a B'-DNA duplex, the residence time of the water molecule next to H2 of adenine(6) (underlined), is 0.6 ns at 10 degreesC, in good agreement with the value obtained previously. The residence time is slightly but distinctly shorter for the water next to A5, suggesting non-cooperative departure of these two molecules which are presumed to be part of the hydration spine. Near A5 and A4 of [d(AAAAATTTTT)]2, another B'-DNA duplex, the residence times are approximately twice as long, but the activation enthalpies are about the same, ca. 38 kJ/mol. The residence time in the minor groove of the regular B-DNA sequence d(CGCGATCGCG) was 0.3 ns at 10 degreesC, shorter than in the case of the B'-DNA sequences by factors of 2 and 4, respectively. The temperature dependence is less, with an activation enthalpy of 27 kJ/mol. The major groove residence times are comparable for the three sequences, and a few times shorter than those of minor groove water. A value of 0.36 ns, or even more in case of rotation of water, is obtained around -8 degreesC. The most striking aspect of these results is the relatively small difference in the residence times of reputedly fast and slow-exchanging water molecules bound to DNA in biological conditions. This suggests that the spine of hydration is perhaps not a major stabilizer of the B'-DNA structure as compared with B-DNA.},

Subsequent coupling of the ESR signal to the detection arm of the spectrometer is also a crucial consideration for achieving high spectrometer sensitivity. In previous work, we found that a means for continuously varying the coupling was necessary for attaining high sensitivity reliably and reproducibly. We report here on a novel asymmetric mesh structure that achieves continuously variable coupling by rotating the mesh in its own plane about the millimeter wave transmission line optical axis. We quantify the performance of this device with nitroxide spin-label spectra in both a lossy aqueous solution and a low loss solid state system. These two systems have very different coupling requirements and are representative of the range of coupling achievable with this technique. Lossy systems in particular are a demanding test of the achievable sensitivity and allow us to assess the suitability of this approach for applying high frequency ESR to the study of biological systems at physiological conditions, for example. The variable coupling technique reported on here allows us to readily achieve a factor of ca. 7 improvement in signal to noise at 170 GHz and a factor of ca. 5 at 95 GHz over what has previously been reported for lossy samples.},

The signal enhancement is achieved through Overhauser-type dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). All presented SL-heparins show high (1)H DNP enhancement factors up to E=-110, which validates that effectively more than one hyperfine line can be saturated even for spin-labeled polarizing agents. The parameters for the Overhauser-type DNP are determined and discussed. A striking result is that for spin-labeled heparins, the off-resonant electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) hyperfine lines contribute a non-negligible part to the total saturation, even in the absence of Heisenberg spin exchange (HSE) and electron spin-nuclear spin relaxation (T(1ne)). As a result, we conclude that one can optimize the use of, for example, biomacromolecules for DNP, for which only small sample amounts are available, by using heterogeneously distributed radicals attached to the molecule.},

With the coarse-grained field thus defined, the string method in collective variables was used to compute a minimum free-energy pathway (MFEP) for the collapsing chain. These calculations provide a proof of principle for a coarse-grained description of water solvent. Furthermore, the calculated MFEP characterizes the mechanism for the collapse of the hydrated chain by providing a path of maximum likelihood for dynamical trajectories. The reliability of the calculated MFEP was confirmed with the use of conventional molecular dynamics trajectories. Analysis of the MFEP provides atomistic confirmation for the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse proposed by ten Wolde and Chandler. In particular, we show that length-scale-dependent hydrophobic dewetting is the rate-limiting step in the hydrophobic collapse of the considered chain.},

However, a fast growing list of examples illustrate the intimate link between internal motions over a wide range of time scales and function in protein-ligand interactions. Proteins respond to perturbations by redistributing their motions and they use fluctuating conformational states for binding and conformational entropy as a carrier of allosteric energy to modulate association with ligands. In several cases allosteric interactions proceed with minimal or no structural changes. We discuss emerging paradigms for the central role of protein dynamics in allostery.},

Cubic mesoporous silica films prepared from strongly acidic solutions were subsequently functionalized under highly alkaline conditions to incorporate hydrophilic aluminosilica surface moieties, followed by nonaqueous conditions to introduce perfluorosulfonic-acid surface groups. Such sequential combination of individually incompatible steps yielded stable mesoporous films with high surface hydrophilicities and strong acid functionalities that exhibited high proton conductivities (ca. 9 × 10(-2) S/cm) at elevated temperatures (120 °C). Molecular, mesoscopic, and macroscopic properties of the multiply functionalized films were monitored and correlated at each stage of the syntheses by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental analysis, adsorption, and ion conductivity measurements.

In contrast, diffusion of Ficoll in protein solutions of concentration comparable to the range reported for cytoplasm is not hindered in a size-dependent manner. Although we cannot at present distinguish among several physical chemical models for the organization of cytoplasm, these results make it clear that cytoplasm possesses some sort of higher-order intermolecular interactions (structure) not found in simple aqueous protein solutions, even at high concentration. These results also suggest that, for native cytoplasmic particles whose smallest radial dimension approaches 260 A, size may be as important a determinant of cytoplasmic diffusibility as binding specificity.

Here, we report that the metabolic effects of resveratrol result from competitive inhibition of cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases, leading to elevated cAMP levels. The resulting activation of Epac1, a cAMP effector protein, increases intracellular Ca(2+) levels and activates the CamKK$\beta$-AMPK pathway via phospholipase C and the ryanodine receptor Ca(2+)-release channel. As a consequence, resveratrol increases NAD(+) and the activity of Sirt1. Inhibiting PDE4 with rolipram reproduces all of the metabolic benefits of resveratrol, including prevention of diet-induced obesity and an increase in mitochondrial function, physical stamina, and glucose tolerance in mice.

The combination of the measured self-diffusion coefficient D and the average translational relaxation time tau(T), as measured by neutron scattering, shows the predicted breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in deeply supercooled water.},

J. 68:1507-1517, 1995; Koyama et al., Photochem. Photobiol. 68:400-406, 1998). In this paper, we concluded that pH changes caused by proton transfer by the deposited BR or proteorhodopsin (PR) films lead to the flash-induced potential change in the SnO(2) electrode. Thus, the signals originate from BR and PR acting as light-driven proton pumps. This conclusion was drawn from the following observations. (1) The relation between the potential of a bare electrode and pH is linear for a wide pH range. (2) The flash-induced potential changes decrease with an increase in the buffer concentration. (3) The action spectrum of PR agrees well with the absorption spectrum. (4) The present electrode can monitor the pH change in the time range from 10 ms to several hundred milliseconds, as deduced by comparing the SnO(2) signal with the signals of pH-sensitive dyes. Using this electrode system, flash-induced proton transfer by BR was measured for a wide pH range from 2 to 10. From these data, we reconfirmed various pK(a) values reported previously, indicating that the present method can give the correct pK(a) values. This is the first report to estimate these pK(a) values directly from the proton transfer. We then applied this method to flash-induced proton transfer of PR. We observed proton uptake followed by release for the pH range from 4 to 9.5, and in other pH ranges, proton release followed by uptake was observed.},

  abstract = {Applications of broadband pulses for EPR have been reported for FID, echo detection and inversion pulses recently. Here we present a broadband Hahn, stimulated and refocused echo sequence derived from adiabatic pulses. The formation of echoes is accomplished by using variable chirp rates and pulse lengths. In all three broadband echo experiments the complete spectral shape of a nitroxide (about 70 Gauss at X-band frequency) could be recovered by Fourier transformation of the quadrature detected echo signals. Such broadband echoes provide an exciting opportunity to optimize pulse sequences where a full excitation of the spectrum is mandatory for an optimum performance. We applied our pulses to the SIFTER (single frequency technique for refocusing dipolar couplings) experiment, a solid echo based pulse sequence to measure the dipolar coupling between two unpaired electron spins. By employing our broadband Hahn echo sequence on a nitroxide biradical we could achieve an artifact free dipolar evolution time trace in the SIFTER experiment with 95{\%} modulation depth at X-band frequency and of 10{\%} modulation depth at Q-band frequency.},

Inclusion of ringdown suppression in numerical pulse optimizations significantly reduces spectrometer deadtime when using high quality factor (high-Q) resonators, leading to increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity of inductive measurements. To demonstrate the method, we experimentally measure the free-induction decay of an inhomogeneously broadened solid-state free radical spin system at high Q. The measurement is enabled by using a numerically optimized bandwidth-limited OCT pulse, including ringdown suppression, robust to variations in static and microwave field strengths. We also discuss the applications of pulse design in high-Q resonators to universal control of anisotropic-hyperfine coupled electron-nuclear spin systems via electron-only modulation even when the bandwidth of the resonator is significantly smaller than the hyperfine coupling strength. These results demonstrate how limitations imposed by linear response theory may be vastly exceeded when using a sufficiently accurate system model to optimize pulses of high complexity.},

  abstract  = {Biological processes often involve the surfaces of proteins, where the structural and dynamic properties of the aqueous solvent are modified. Information about the dynamics of protein hydration can be obtained by measuring the magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) of the water (2)H and (17)O nuclei or by recording the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) between water and protein protons. Here, we use the MRD method to study the hydration of the cyclic peptide oxytocin and the globular protein BPTI in deeply supercooled solutions. The results provide a detailed characterization of water dynamics in the hydration layer at the surface of these biomolecules. More than 95{\%} of the water molecules in contact with the biomolecular surface are found to be no more than two-fold motionally retarded as compared to bulk water. In contrast to small nonpolar molecules, the retardation factor for BPTI showed little or no temperature dependence, suggesting that the exposed nonpolar residues do not induce clathrate-like hydrophobic hydration structures. New NOE data for oxytocin and published NOE data for BPTI were analyzed, and a mutually consistent interpretation of MRD and NOE results was achieved with the aid of a new theory of intermolecular dipolar relaxation that accounts explicitly for the dynamic perturbation at the biomolecular surface. The analysis indicates that water-protein NOEs are dominated by long-range dipolar couplings to bulk water, unless the monitored protein proton is near a partly or fully buried hydration site where the water molecule has a long residence time.},

At 250 MHz T, is shorter than at X-band and more strongly dependent on viscosity. The enhanced relaxation at 250 MHz is attributed to modulation of electron-proton dipolar coupling by tumbling of the trityl radicals at rates that are comparable to the reciprocal of the resonance frequency. Deuteration of the solvent was used to distinguish relaxation due to solvent protons from the relaxation due to intra-molecular electron-proton interactions at 250 MHz. For trityl-CD3, which contains no protons, modulation of dipolar interaction with solvent protons dominates T-1. For proton-containing radicals the relative importance of modulation of intra- and inter-molecular proton interactions varies with solution viscosity. The viscosity and frequency dependence of T-1 was modeled based on dipolar interaction with a defined number of protons at specified distances from the unpaired electron. At each of the frequencies examined T-2 decreases with increasing viscosity consistent with contributions from T-1 and from incomplete motional averaging of anisotropic hyperfine interaction.

The order parameter, which is most often used as a measure of membrane fluidity, describes the amplitude of wobbling motion of alkyl chains relative to the membrane normal and does not contain explicitly time or velocity. Thus, this parameter can be considered as nondynamic. The spin-lattice relaxation rate (T(1)(-1)) obtained from saturation-recovery EPR measurements of lipid spin labels in deoxygenated samples depends primarily on the rotational correlation time of the nitroxide moiety within the lipid bilayer. Thus, T(1)(-1) can be used as a convenient quantitative measure of membrane fluidity that reflects local membrane dynamics. T(1)(-1) profiles obtained for 1-palmitoyl-2-(n-doxylstearoyl)phosphatidylcholine (n-PC) spin labels in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membranes with and without 50 mol{\%} cholesterol are presented in parallel with profiles of the rotational diffusion coefficient, R(⊥), obtained from simulation of EPR spectra using Freed's model. These profiles are compared with profiles of the order parameter obtained directly from EPR spectra and with profiles of the order parameter obtained from simulation of EPR spectra. It is shown that T(1)(-1) and R(⊥) profiles reveal changes in membrane fluidity that depend on the motional properties of the lipid alkyl chain. We find that cholesterol has a rigidifying effect only to the depth occupied by the rigid steroid ring structure and a fluidizing effect at deeper locations. These effects cannot be differentiated by profiles of the order parameter. All profiles in this study were obtained at X-band (9.5 GHz).},

  abstract = {Hydrophobic interactions drive many important biomolecular self-assembly phenomena. However, characterizing hydrophobicity at the nanoscale has remained a challenge due to its nontrivial dependence on the chemistry and topography of biomolecular surfaces. Here we use molecular simulations coupled with enhanced sampling methods to systematically displace water molecules from the hydration shells of nanostructured solutes and calculate the free energetics of interfacial water density fluctuations, which quantify the extent of solute$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}water adhesion, and therefore solute hydrophobicity. In particular, we characterize the hydrophobicity of curved graphene sheets, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with chemical patterns, and mutants of the protein hydrophobin-II. We find that water density fluctuations are enhanced near concave nonpolar surfaces compared with those near flat or convex ones, suggesting that concave surfaces are more hydrophobic. We also find that patterned SAMs and protein mutants, having the same number of nonpolar and polar sites but different geometrical arrangements, can display significantly different strengths of adhesion with water. Specifically, hydroxyl groups reduce the hydrophobicity of methyl-terminated SAMs most effectively not when they are clustered together but when they are separated by one methyl group. Hydrophobin-II mutants show that a charged amino acid reduces the hydrophobicity of a large nonpolar patch when placed at its center, rather than at its edge. Our results highlight the power of water density fluctuations-based measures to characterize the hydrophobicity of nanoscale surfaces and caution against the use of additive approximations, such as the commonly used surface area models or hydropathy scales for characterizing biomolecular hydrophobicity and the associated driving forces of assembly.},

abstract = {Most proteins function in nature under crowded conditions, and crowding can change protein properties. Quantification of crowding effects, however, is difficult because solutions containing hundreds of grams of macromolecules per liter often interfere with the observation of the protein being studied. Models for macromolecular crowding tend to focus on the steric effects of crowders, neglecting potential chemical interactions between the crowder and the test protein. Here, we report the first systematic, quantitative, residue-level study of crowding effects on the equilibrium stability of a globular protein. We used a system comprising poly(vinylpyrrolidone)s (PVPs) of varying molecular weights as crowding agents and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) as a small globular test protein. Stability was quantified with NMR-detected amide (1)H exchange. We analyzed the data in terms of hard particle exclusion, confinement, and soft interactions. For all crowded conditions, nearly every observed residue experiences a stabilizing effect. The exceptions are residues for which stabilities are unchanged. At a PVP concentration of 100 g/L, the data are consistent with theories of hard particle exclusion. At higher concentrations, the data are more consistent with confinement. The data show that the crowder also stabilizes the test protein by weakly binding its native state. We conclude that the role of native-state binding and other soft interactions needs to be seriously considered when applying both theory and experiment to studies of macromolecular crowding.},

  abstract = {A combined 250 and 9 GHz ESR study was performed on membrane vesicles composed of pure lipid (DPPC) and of DPPC:cholesterol in a 1:1 molar ratio using the end chain labeled lipid, 16-PC. It is shown that the 250 GHz spectra represent a “fast time-scale” such that the overall restricted motion of the lipid in the membrane is frozen out, but it is sensitive to the internal dynamics of the end chain. The 9 GHz spectra are, however, sensitive to the overall motion as well. This combined study thus permitted the separation of both types of motion. It is shown that the addition of cholesterol has a large effect on the end chain dynamics by restricting its motion while increasing motional rates, whereas its effects on the overall lipid motion are modest. This leads to a clearer characterization of the dynamic structure of the cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered phase as compared to the liquid crystalline phase. This study thus shows the significant potential of a multifrequency ESR approach to the complex dynamics of membranes.},

  abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential components of cellular signaling pathways. They are the targets of many current pharmaceuticals and are postulated to dimerize or oligomerize in cellular membranes in conjunction with their functional mechanisms. We demonstrate using fluorescence resonance energy transfer how association of rhodopsin occurs by long-range lipid-protein interactions due to geometrical forces, yielding greater receptor crowding. Constitutive association of rhodopsin is promoted by a reduction in membrane thickness (hydrophobic mismatch), but also by an increase in protein/lipid molar ratio, showing the importance of interactions extending well beyond a single annulus of boundary lipids. The fluorescence data correlate with the pK(a) for the MI-to-MII transition of rhodopsin, where deprotonation of the retinylidene Schiff base occurs in conjunction with helical movements leading to activation of the photoreceptor. A more dispersed membrane environment optimizes formation of the MII conformation that results in visual function. A flexible surface model explains both the dispersal and activation of rhodopsin in terms of bilayer curvature deformation (strain) and hydrophobic solvation energy. The bilayer stress is related to the lateral pressure profile in terms of the spontaneous curvature and associated bending rigidity. Transduction of the strain energy (frustration) of the bilayer drives protein oligomerization and conformational changes in a coupled manner. Our findings illuminate the physical principles of membrane protein association due to chemically nonspecific interactions in fluid lipid bilayers. Moreover, they yield a conceptual framework for understanding how the tightly regulated lipid compositions of cellular membranes influence their protein-mediated functions.},

Experimental approaches employ variations of surface specificity through even-order nonlinear spectroscopy, or in isotopic samples using intrinsic or extrinsic probes coupled with ultrafast transient absorption, time-resolved fluorescence, multidimensional infrared, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Theoretical developments have focused on linking the interface-induced perturbations with the resulting motion of the hydrating water molecules, with a principal focus on changes in the free energy surface. Both theory and simulation have been instrumental in modeling the microscopic molecular dynamics as well as in computing experimental observables arising from the dynamics. This article provides an overview of experimental techniques that have been applied to study interfacial water dynamics, highlighting the numerous successes, as well as pointing out future directions. Since theoretical work is so central to the understanding of water, this article also outlines the extensive progress made using models and computational simulation.},

This analysis includes processes such as centrifugation and drying and physical effects due to membrane fragment steric interactions, finite size, elasticity, and thermal fluctuations. Several model calculations of optimal orientational order in multilayer membrane arrays are presented. The predictions of a smectic A model agree quantitatively with the measured spatial dependence of the fluctuations in layer orientation in a multilamellar arrays. A new technique, based in part on this analysis, for the preparation of well-oriented multilamellar arrays of natural and artificial membranes, isopotential spin-dry centrifugation, is described. The method involves the use of specially designed inserts for the buckets of a standard vacuum ultracentrifuge. The membrane fragments to be oriented are sedimented from solution or suspension onto a substrate of a convenient material which forms a gravitational isopotential surface at high g. Sedimentation is accompanied by removal of the suspending medium at high g to produce oriented films with a selected degree of solvation. In addition, a method is described whereby small solute molecules can be maintained in constant concentration with the membrane fragments during this process. Initial application of the method to the orientation of purple membrane fragments is described. The degree of orientation obtained in this system is evaluated using freeze-fracture and scanning electron microscopy, optical birefringence, linear dichroism, and microscopy.},

The interaction of the electron spin with the mw field is treated as an electron spin dressed state. In contrast to the customary laboratory frame solid effect, it is possible to obtain nuclear polarization with the dressed state solid effect (DSSE) even in the absence of nonsecular hyperfine coupling. Efficient, selective excitation of dressed state transitions generates nuclear polarization in the nuclear laboratory frame on a time scale of tens of $\mu$s, depending on the strength of the electron–nuclear coupling, the mw and rf offset and field strength. The experiment employs both pulsed mw and rf irradiation at a repetition rate comparable to T1e−1, where T1e is the electronic spin lattice relaxation time.

  abstract  = {The e.s.r. spectra of nitroxide radicals are widely used to study environmental effects, especially for labelled biomolecules. However, e.s.r. spectra are, in general, time-averaged records of the environmental constraints experienced by the NO˙ species. This averaging often shows up as a contribution to the linewidths, but the hyperfine coupling, A(14N), and g values are time-averaged values.We have used non-averaging spectroscopic techniques (infrared, Raman and electronic spectroscopies) to obtain further information about the structures of nitroxide solvates. Unfortunately, the environmental sensitivity of the N—O stretching frequency proved to be so low that definitive results were difficult to obtain without careful computer analyses. Since the visible absorption band at ca. 23 000 cm–1 can be measured with great accuracy, it was used in the major part of this study.Systematic variations in vmax for the 23000 cm–1 band for pure solvents followed a similar trend to that for the CO stretching frequency of acetone. This suggests that the mode of solvation for the CO and NO units is similar. For mixed solvents, in contrast to previous work on acetone systems, we were not generally able to resolve the experimental spectra into two or more components because the shift-width ratios were too small. However, by experimenting with a series of computer-constructed curves, we have established that skew bands comprising two Gaussian bands of very different intensities can be uniquely analysed to give the position of the weak band. Hence, we have shown that for water + aprotic-solvent systems nitroxides form three distinct solvates, whilst methanol + aprotic-solvent systems form only two. Since the intermediate band of the aqueous systems is close to that for the nitroxide in methanol, we postulate that water forms two hydrogen bonds, falling to one as the aprotic solvent is added, whereas methanol only forms a monosolvate. These conclusions are identical with those deduced for acetone solutions, using the CO stretching band as a gauge. Detailed comparison shows that the nitroxides behave as slightly stronger bases than the ketones. These results are used to reinterpret certain e.s.r. results, and it is suggested that nitroxide spin labels used in the study of membranes are often mono- rather than di-hydrated.},

  abstract = {NMR relaxation experiments have provided a wealth of information about molecular motions in macromolecules and ordered fluids. Even though a rigorous theory of spin relaxation is available, the complexity of the investigated systems often makes the interpretation of limited datasets challenging and ambiguous. To allow physically meaningful information to be extracted from the data without commitment to detailed dynamical models, several versions of a model-free (MF) approach to data analysis have been developed. During the past 2 decades, the MF approach has been used in the vast majority of all NMR relaxation studies of internal motions in proteins and other macromolecules, and it has also played an important role in studies of colloidal systems. Although the MF approach has been almost universally adopted, substantial disagreement remains about its physical foundations and range of validity. It is our aim here to clarify these issues. To this end, we first present rigorous derivations of the three well-known MF formulas for the time correlation function relevant for isotropic solutions. These derivations are more general than the original ones, thereby substantially extending the range of validity of the MF approach. We point out several common misconceptions and explain the physical significance of the approximations involved. In particular, we discuss symmetry requirements and the dynamical decoupling approximation that plays a key role in the MF approach. We also derive a new MF formula, applicable to anisotropic fluids and solids, including microcrystalline protein samples. The so-called slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) model has been advanced as an alternative to the MF approach that does not require dynamical decoupling of internal and global motions. To resolve the existing controversy about the relative merits of the SRLS model and the MF approach, we formulate and solve a planar version of the SRLS model. The analytical solution of this model reveals the unphysical consequences of the symmetrical two-body Smoluchowski equation as applied to protein dynamics, thus refuting the widely held belief that the SRLS model is more accurate than the MF approach. The different results obtained by analyzing data with these two approaches therefore do not indicate the importance of dynamical coupling between internal and global motions. Finally, we explore the two principal mechanisms of dynamical coupling in proteins: torque-mediated and friction-mediated coupling. We argue by way of specific analytically solvable models that torque-mediated coupling (which the SRLS model attempts to capture) is unimportant because the relatively slow internal motions that might couple to the global motion tend to be intermittent (jumplike) in character, whereas friction-mediated coupling (which neither the SRLS model nor the MF approach incorporates) may be important for proteins with unstructured parts or flexibly connected domains.},

  abstract = {We describe a two-scale modeling approach toward anion specificity at surfaces of varying charge and polarity. Explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at neutral hydrophobic (i.e., nonpolar) and neutral hydrophilic (i.e., polar) self-assembled monolayers furnish potentials of mean force for Na(+) and the halide anions F(-), Cl(-), and I(-) which are then used within Poisson-Boltzmann theory to calculate ionic distributions at surfaces of arbitrary charge for finite ion concentration. On the basis of calculated long-ranged electrostatic forces and coagulation properties, we obtain the direct anionic Hofmeister series at negatively charged hydrophobic surfaces. Reversal takes place when going to negative polar or to positive nonpolar surfaces, leading to the indirect series, while for positive polar surfaces the direct series is again obtained. This is in full accordance with a recent experimental classification of colloidal coagulation kinetics and also reflects the trends of the ion specific solubility properties of proteins. A schematic Hofmeister phase diagram is proposed. Partial series reversal is understood as a transient phenomenon for surfaces of intermediate polarity or charge.},

abstract = {$\beta$-Lactoglobulin ($\beta$-lg) forms fibrils when heated at 80 °C, pH 2, and low ionic strength ({\textless}0.015 mM). When formed at protein concentrations {\textless}3{\%}, these fibrils are made up of peptides produced from the acid hydrolysis of the $\beta$-lg monomer. The present study investigated the effects of the polyhydroxy alcohols (polyols) glycerol and sorbitol (0-50{\%} w/v) on $\beta$-lg self-assembly at pH 2. Glycerol and sorbitol stabilize native protein structure and modulate protein functionality by preferential exclusion. In our study, both polyols decreased the rate of $\beta$-lg self-assembly but had no effect on the morphology of fibrils. The mechanism of these effects was studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. Sorbitol inhibited self-assembly by stabilizing $\beta$-lg against unfolding and hydrolysis, resulting in fewer fibrillogenic species, whereas glycerol inhibited nucleation without inhibiting hydrolysis. Both polyols increased the viscosity of the solutions, but viscosity appeared to have little effect on fibril assembly, and we believe that self-assembly was not diffusion-limited under these conditions. This is in agreement with previous reports for other proteins assembling under different conditions. The phenomenon of peptide self-assembly can be decoupled from protein hydrolysis using glycerol.},

The physical underpinnings of this phenomenon have been investigated extensively but remain controversial. Changes in solvation energetics have been commonly proposed as a driving force for pressure-induced unfolding. Recently, the elimination of void volumes in the native folded state has been argued to be the principal determinant. Here we use the cavity-containing L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme to examine the pressure-induced destabilization of this multidomain protein by using solution NMR spectroscopy. The cavity-containing C-terminal domain completely unfolds at moderate pressures, whereas the N-terminal domain remains largely structured to pressures as high as 2.5 kbar. The sensitivity to pressure is suppressed by the binding of benzene to the hydrophobic cavity. These results contrast to the pseudo-WT protein, which has a residual cavity volume very similar to that of the L99A-benzene complex but shows extensive subglobal reorganizations with pressure. Encapsulation of the L99A mutant in the aqueous nanoscale core of a reverse micelle is used to examine the hydration of the hydrophobic cavity. The confined space effect of encapsulation suppresses the pressure-induced unfolding transition and allows observation of the filling of the cavity with water at elevated pressures. This indicates that hydration of the hydrophobic cavity is more energetically unfavorable than global unfolding. Overall, these observations point to a range of cooperativity and energetics within the T4 lysozyme molecule and illuminate the fact that small changes in physical parameters can significantly alter the pressure sensitivity of proteins.},

abstract = {The process of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be qualitatively understood by a simple heat contact between bodies of different heat capacities. These bodies are identified with the three thermal reservoirs corresponding to the electron Zeeman, the electron dipole-dipole and the nuclear Zeeman interaction. The primary cooling process itself, which consists of an off-resonance irradiation of the electron Zeeman reservoir, may be interpreted as a continuous and thus non-adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating frame of reference. In order to maximize the nuclear polarization in the case, when all three bodies are in contact with each other (EST model), it is immediately seen that the heat capacity of the electron dipolar reservoir has to be minimized. Furthermore, this graphical description is very helpful in illustrating, how the completely different approach to the DNP process, the solid effect model, can be implemented into the spin temperature theory.

The thiol containing membrane proteins shows ultraslow response with average solvation time, ⟨$\tau$s⟩ = 475 ps. CPM labeled exofacial thiols also show spontaneous, intermittent oscillation in fluorescence intensity with a period of 0.5-1.0 s.

  abstract      = {Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit complex, which catalyzes the photo-induced oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. Difference Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy can be used to obtain information about the structural changes accompanying oxidation of the redox-active tyrosines, D and Z, in PSII. The focus of our work is the assignment of the 1478 cm-1 vibration, which is observable in difference infrared spectra associated with these tyrosyl radicals. The first set of FT-IR experiments is performed with continuous illumination. Use of cyanobacterial strains, in which isotopomers of tyrosine have been incorporated, supports the assignment of a positive 1478/1477 cm-1 mode to the CtextendashO stretching vibration of the tyrosyl radicals. In negative controls, the intensity of this spectral feature decreases. The negative controls involve the use of inhibitors or site-directed mutants, in which the oxidation of Z or D is eliminated, respectively. The assignment of the 1478/1477 cm-1 mode is also based on control EPR and fluorescence measurements, which demonstrate that no detectable Fe+2QA- signal is generated under FT-IR experimental conditions. Additionally, the difference infrared spectrum, associated with formation of the S2QA- state, argues against the assignment of the positive 1478 cm-1 line to the CtextendashO vibration of QA-. In the second set of FT-IR experiments, single turnover flashes are employed, and infrared difference spectra are recorded as a function of time after photoexcitation. Comparison to kinetic transients generated in control EPR experiments shows that the decay of the 1477 cm-1 line precisely parallels the decay of the Dcdot EPR signal. Taken together, these two experimental approaches strongly support the assignment of a component of the 1478/1477 cm-1 vibrational lines to the CtextendashO stretching modes of tyrosyl radicals in PSII.

  abstract = {"Hot spots" are residues accounting for the majority of the protein-protein binding free energy (BFE) despite that they comprise only a small fraction of the protein-protein interface. A hot spot can be found experimentally by measuring the BFE change upon mutating it to alanine: the mutation gives rise to a significantly large increase in the BFE. Theoretical prediction of hot spots is an enthusiastic subject in biophysics, biochemistry, and bioinformatics. For the development of a reliable prediction method, it is essential to understand the physical origin of hot spots. To this end, we calculate the water-entropy gains upon binding both for a wild-type complex and for its mutant complex using a hybrid method of the angle-dependent integral equation theory applied to a molecular model for water and the morphometric approach. We note that this type of calculation has never been employed in the previously reported methods. The BFE change due to alanine mutation is evaluated only from the change in the water-entropy gain with no parameters fitted to the experimental data. It is shown that the overall performance of predicting hot spots in our method is higher than that in Robetta, a standard free-energy-based method using fitting parameters, when the most widely used criterion for defining an actual hot spot is adopted. This result strongly suggests that the water-entropy effect we calculate is the key factor governing basic physics of hot spots.},

abstract = {This chapter summarizes the recent developments in both convention and hyperpolarized (HP) xenon NMR experiments. Xenon NMR has been used in a growing number of spectroscopy and imaging approaches to physical, chemical, and biological problems. Because of its sensitivity to chemical environment, its inertness, and now the ability to create high polarization through optical pumping xenon has become an extremely useful NMR nucleus to probe an enormous range of materials. Increasingly, we find that unusual materials are being examined with xenon NMR. In addition, more powerful computational methods are now available, making the calculation of xenon chemical shifts possible under a variety of experimentally simulated situations. Approximately half of the papers published over the past 7 years now involve the use of HP xenon because of the dramatic enhancement in sensitivity it affords, and because the optical pumping technology has become more routine. This advance has given rise to a significant increase in the papers that describe the use of 2D methods for xenon NMR as well as static and even dynamic imaging. Some of the rather exotic new methods that have been proposed recently promise to enhance the sensitivity and applicability of xenon NMR experiments well into the future.},

Recent progress has illuminated the possibility of employing NMR relaxation methods to quantitatively determine the role of changes in conformational entropy in molecular recognition by proteins. The method rests on using fast internal protein dynamics as a proxy. Initial results reveal a large and variable role for conformational entropy in the binding of ligands by proteins. Such a role for conformational entropy in molecular recognition has significant implications for enzymology, signal transduction, allosteric regulation and the development of protein-directed pharmaceuticals.},

Optimal control enables efficient optimization of NMR experiments in terms of amplitudes, phases, offsets etc. for hundreds-to-thousands of pulses to fully exploit the experimentally available high degree of freedom in pulse sequences to combat variations/limitations in experimental or spin system parameters or design experiments with specific properties typically not covered as easily by standard design procedures. This facilitates straightforward optimization of experiments under consideration of rf and static field inhomogeneities, limitations in available or desired rf field strengths (e.g., for reduction of sample heating), spread in resonance offsets or coupling parameters, variations in spin systems etc. to meet the actual experimental conditions as close as possible. The paper provides a brief account on the relevant theory and in particular the computational interface relevant for optimization of state-to-state transfer (on the density operator level) and the effective Hamiltonian on the level of propagators along with several representative examples within liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.},

  abstract   = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0{\textless}ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0{\textless}ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

The EPR line broadening due to electron-electron dipolar interactions in the frozen state was determined using the Fourier deconvolution method. These dipolar spectra were then used to estimate the distances between the two nitroxides separated by 8-25 A. Results agreed well with a simple alpha-helical model. The standard deviation from the model system was 0.9 A in the range of 8-25 A. This technique is applicable to complex systems such as membrane receptors and channels, which are difficult to access with high-resolution NMR or x-ray crystallography, and is expected to be particularly useful for systems for which optical methods are hampered by the presence of light-interfering membranes or chromophores.},

Ionic liquid based membranes were more flexible than neat SPEK membrane due to the plasticization effect of ionic liquids. The interactions and compatibility occurring among components were investigated by vibration spectroscopy (FTIR ATR) and scanning electron microscopy respectively. The thermal stability of composite membranes was higher than unmodified membranes. The ion conductivity of composite membranes under anhydrous conditions was found to be dependent on temperature, type and concentration of ionic liquid in SPEK matrix. Ion conductivities of composite membranes under anhydrous condition were found to be up to two orders (∼100 times) higher than neat SPEK membrane and it was found to be ∼5 mS/cm at 140 °C for SPEK/OTf-70. These composite membranes can be successfully operated at temperatures ranging from 40 °C to 140 °C under anhydrous conditions.},

Control over the formation of CH(3)CO from (CH3)2CO, CF3 (or CH3) from CH3COCF3, and C6H5CH3 (toluene) from C6H5COCH3 was observed with high selectivity. Strong-field control appears to have generic applicability for manipulating molecular reactivity because the tailored intense laser fields (about 10(13) watts per square centimeter) can dynamically Stark shift many excited states into resonance, and consequently, the method is not confined by resonant spectral restrictions found in the perturbative (weak-field) regime.},

abstract = {The chaperonin GroEL assists the folding of nascent or stress-denatured polypeptides by actions of binding and encapsulation. ATP binding initiates a series of conformational changes triggering the association of the cochaperonin GroES, followed by further large movements that eject the substrate polypeptide from hydrophobic binding sites into a GroES-capped, hydrophilic folding chamber. We used cryo-electron microscopy, statistical analysis, and flexible fitting to resolve a set of distinct GroEL-ATP conformations that can be ordered into a trajectory of domain rotation and elevation. The initial conformations are likely to be the ones that capture polypeptide substrate. Then the binding domains extend radially to separate from each other but maintain their binding surfaces facing the cavity, potentially exerting mechanical force upon kinetically trapped, misfolded substrates. The extended conformation also provides a potential docking site for GroES, to trigger the final, 100° domain rotation constituting the "power stroke" that ejects substrate into the folding chamber.},

  abstract  = {Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is the method of choice to study paramagnetic cofactors that often play an important role as active centers in electron transfer processes in biological systems. However, in many cases more than one paramagnetic species is contributing to the observed EPR spectrum, making the analysis of individual contributions difficult and in some cases impossible. With time-domain techniques it is possible to exploit differences in the relaxation behavior of different paramagnetic species to distinguish between them and separate their individual spectral contribution. Here we give an overview of the use of pulsed EPR spectroscopy to study the iron-sulfur clusters of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). While FeS cluster N1 can be studied individually at a temperature of 30 K, this is not possible for FeS cluster N2 due to its severe spectral overlap with cluster N1. In this case Relaxation Filtered Hyperfine (REFINE) spectroscopy can be used to separate the overlapping spectra based on differences in their relaxation behavior.},

  abstract  = {The effects of cholesterol on the dynamics and the structural properties of two different spin probes, the sterol type CSL and the phospholipid type 16-PC, in POPC/cholesterol oriented multilayer model membranes were examined. Our results are consistent with a nonideal solution containing cholesterol-rich clusters created by the self association of cholesterol in POPC model membranes. The lateral diffusion coefficient D of the spin probes was measured over the temperature range of 15 to 60 degrees C and over the concentration range of 0 to 30 mol{\%} of cholesterol in the model membrane by the electron spin resonance (ESR) imaging method. The rotational diffusion coefficients (including R perpendicular) and the order parameter S were determined utilizing a nonlinear least square ESR spectral simulation method. D, R perpendicular and S of CSL deviate considerably from linear dependence on mole percent cholesterol. The D of CSL was decreased by a factor of four at 15 degrees C and a factor of two at 60 degrees C for concentrations of cholesterol over 10 mol {\%}, whereas those of 16-PC were hardly affected. Cholesterol decreased R perpendicular by a factor of 10 at 30 mol {\%} of cholesterol, but it increased slightly that of 16-PC. A significant increase of S for CSL due to the presence of cholesterol was observed. It is shown how the difference in variation of S for CSL vs. 16-PC with composition may be interpreted in terms of their respective activity coefficients, and how a single universal linear relation is obtained for the S of both probes in terms of a scaled temperature. Simple but general correlations of D and of R perpendicular with S were also found, which aid in the interpretation of these diffusion coefficients.},

  abstract      = {We describe an experiment, in situ temperature jump dynamic nuclear polarization (TJ-DNP), that is demonstrated to enhance sensitivity in liquid-state NMR experiments of low-gamma spins - (13)C, (15)N, etc. The approach consists of polarizing a sample at low temperature using high-frequency (140 GHz) microwaves and a biradical polarizing agent and then melting it rapidly with a pulse of 10.6 mum infrared radiation, followed by observation of the NMR signal in the presence of decoupling. In the absence of polarization losses due to relaxation, the enhancement should be epsilon(dagger) = epsilon(T(obs)/T(mu)(wave)), where epsilon(dagger) is the observed enhancement, epsilon is the enhancement obtained at the temperature where the polarization process occurs, and T(mu)(wave) and T(obs) are the polarization and observation temperatures, respectively. In a single experimental cycle, we observe room-temperature enhancements, epsilon(dagger), of (13)C signals in the range 120-400 when using a 140 GHz gyrotron microwave source, T(mu)(wave) = 90 K, and T(obs) = 300 K. In addition, we demonstrate that the experiment can be recycled to perform signal averaging that is customary in contemporary NMR spectroscopy. Presently, the experiment is applicable to samples that can be repeatedly frozen and thawed. TJ-DNP could also serve as the initial polarization step in experiments designed for rapid acquisition of multidimensional spectra. [Journal Article; In English; United States; In-Process]},

EPR at high fields and high frequencies (HF-EPR) has been established up to THz (very high frequency (VHF) EPR) in continuous wave (cw) operation and up to about 300 GHz in pulsed operation. To date, its most prominent application field is structural biology. This review article first gives an overview of the theoretical basics and the technical aspects of HF-EPR methodologies, such as cw and pulsed HF-EPR, as well as electron nuclear double resonance at high fields (HF-ENDOR). In the second part, the article illustrates different application areas of HF-EPR in studies of protein structure and function. In particular, HF-EPR has delivered essential contributions to disentangling complex spectra of radical cofactors or reaction intermediates in photosynthetic reaction centres, radical enzymes (such as ribonucleotide reductase) and in metalloproteins. Furthermore, HF-EPR combined with site-directed spin labelling in membranes and soluble proteins provides new methods of investigating complex molecular dynamics and intermolecular distances.},

abstract = {The O2-evolving complex of photosystem II, Mn 4Ca, cycles through five oxidation states, S0,..., S4, during its catalytic function, which involves the gradual abstraction of four electrons and four protons from two bound water molecules. The direct oxidant of the complex is the tyrosine neutral radical, YZ(*), which is transiently produced by the highly oxidizing power of the photoexcited chlorophyll species P680. EPR characterization of YZ(*) has been limited, until recently, to inhibited (non-oxygen-evolving) preparations. A number of relatively recent papers have demonstrated the trapping of YZ(*) in O2-evolving preparations at liquid helium temperatures as an intermediate of the S0 to S1, S1 to S2, and S2 to S3 transitions. The respective EPR spectra are broadened and split at g approximately 2 by the magnetic interaction with the Mn cluster, but this interaction collapses at temperatures higher than about 100K [Zahariou et al. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 14335 -14341]. We have conducted a study of the Tyr Z(*) transient in the temperature range 77-240 K by employing rapid or slow EPR scans. The results reveal for the first time high-resolution X-band spectra of Tyr Z(*) in the functional system and at temperatures close to the onset of the S-state transitions. We have simulated the S 2Y Z(*) spectrum using the simulation algorithm of Svistunenko and Cooper [(2004) Biophys. J. 87, 582 -595]. The small g(x) = 2.00689 value inferred from the analysis suggests either a H-bonding of Tyr Z (*) (presumably with His190) that is stronger than what has been assumed from studies of Tyr D(*) or Tyr Z(*) in Mn-depleted preparations or a more electropositive environment around Tyr Z(*). The study has also yielded for the first time direct information on the temperature variation of the YZ(*)/QA(-) recombination reaction in the various S states. The reaction follows biphasic kinetics with the slow phase dominating at low temperatures and the fast phase dominating at high temperatures. It is tentatively proposed that the slow phase represents the action of the YZ(*)/YZ(-) redox couple while the fast phase represents that of the YZ(*)/YZH couple; it is inferred that Tyr Z at elevated temperatures is protonated at rest. It is also proposed that YZ(*)/YZH is the couple that oxidizes the Mn cluster during the S1-S2 and S2-S3 transitions. A simple mechanism ensuring a rapid (concerted) protonation of Tyr Z upon oxidation of the Mn cluster is discussed, and also, a structure-based molecular model suggesting the participation of His190 into two hydrogen bonds is proposed.},

  abstract  = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy's affinity for detecting paramagnetic free radicals, or spins, has been increasingly employed to examine a large variety of biochemical interactions. Such paramagnetic species are broadly found in nature and can be intrinsic (defects in solid-state materials systems, electron/hole pairs, stable radicals in proteins) or, more often, purposefully introduced into the material of interest (doping/attachment of paramagnetic spin labels to biomolecules of interest). Using ESR to trace the reactionary path of paramagnetic spins or spin-active proxy molecules provides detailed information about the reaction's transient species and the label's local environment. For many biochemical systems, like those involving membrane proteins, synthesizing the necessary quantity of spin-labeled biomolecules (typically 50 pmol to 100 pmol) is quite challenging and often limits the possible biochemical reactions available for investigation. Quite simply, ESR is too insensitive. Here, we demonstrate an innovative approach that greatly enhances ESR's sensitivity ({\textgreater}20000× improvement) by developing a near-field, nonresonant, X-band ESR spectrometric method. Sensitivity improvement is confirmed via measurement of 140 amol of the most common nitroxide spin label in a ≈593 fL liquid cell at ambient temperature and pressure. This experimental approach eliminates many of the typical ESR sample restrictions imposed by conventional resonator-based ESR detection and renders the technique feasible for spatially resolved measurements on a wider variety of biochemical samples. Thus, our approach broadens the pool of possible biochemical and structural biology studies, as well as greatly enhances the analytical power of existing ESR applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the interpretation of molecular properties of selected singly and doubly spin-labeled peptides from continuous-wave electron spin resonance (cw-ESR) spectroscopy. This study is performed by means of an integrated computational approach that merges a stochastic treatment of long-term dynamics to ad hoc methodologies for the calculation of structural properties. In particular, our method is based on (i) the determination of geometric and local magnetic parameters of the peptides by quantum mechanical density functional calculations by taking into account solvent contribution; (ii) the hydrodynamic evaluation of dissipative properties; and (iii) molecular dynamics including equilibrium distribution of molecular conformations. The system is then described by a stochastic Liouville equation in which the spin Hamiltonian for the two electron spins, interacting with each other and coupled to two (14)N nuclear spins, is coupled to the diffusive operator describing the time evolution of slow coordinates. cw-ESR spectra are simulated for selected peptides built from the non-natural $\alpha$-aminoacids $\alpha$-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid (TOAC). In particular, we study the -Aib-TOAC-Aib- singly labeled tripeptide and the -Aib-TOAC-(Aib)(7)- singly labeled and -Aib-TOAC-(Aib)(5)-TOAC-Aib- doubly labeled nonapeptides. We show that good agreement is obtained with minimal resorting to fitting procedures, proving that the combination of sensitive ESR spectroscopy and sophisticated modeling is a powerful approach to the investigation of both molecular dynamics and 3D-structural properties.},

The reaction volumes are compact (such as a sphere, a cube, or a cylinder) and do not vary in shape. In this review article, we discuss two important systems at small length scales (approximately 10 nm to 5 microm), in which these basic assumptions are violated. The first system exists in cell biology and is represented by the tiniest functional components (i.e., single cells, organelles, and other physically delineated cellular microenvironments). The second system comprises nanofluidic devices, in particular devices made from soft-matter materials such as lipid nanotube-vesicle networks. In these two systems, transport, mixing, and shape changes can be achieved at or very close to thermal energy levels. In further contrast to macroscopic systems, mixing by diffusion is extremely efficient, and kinetics can be controlled by shape and volume changes.},

  abstract  = {The hydrated ternary lamellar lipid mixture of  dipalmitoyl-PC/dilauroyl-PC/cholesterol (DPPC/DLPC/Chol) has been  studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) to reveal the dynamic  structure on a molecular level of the different phases that exist and  coexist over virtually the full range of composition. The spectra for  more than 100 different compositions at room temperature were analyzed  by nonlinear least-squares fitting to provide the rotational diffusion  rates and order parameters of the end-chain labeled phospholipid 16-PC.  The ESR spectra exhibit substantial variation as a function of  composition, even though the respective phases generally differ rather  modestly from each other. The Lalpha and Lbeta phases are clearly  distinguished, with the former exhibiting substantially lower ordering  and greater motional rates, whereas the well-defined Lo phase exhibits  the greatest ordering and relatively fast motional rates. Typically,  smaller variations occur within a given phase. The ESR spectral  analysis also yields phase boundaries and coexistence regions which are  found to be consistent with previous results from fluorescence methods,  although new features are found. Phase coexistence regions were in some  cases confirmed by observing the existence of isosbestic points in the  absorption mode ESR spectra from the phases. The dynamic structural  properties of the DPPC-rich Lbeta and DLPC-rich Lalpha phases, within  their two-phase coexistence region do not change with composition along  a tie-line, but the ratio of the two phases follows the lever rule in  accordance with thermodynamic principles. The analysis shows that 16-PC  spin-label partitions nearly equally between the Lalpha and Lbeta  phases, making it a useful probe for studying such coexisting phases.  Extensive study of two-phase coexistence regions requires the  determination of tie-lines, which were approximated in this study.  However, a method is suggested to accurately determine the tie-lines by  ESR.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, the ribosome-Sec61 translocon complex (RTC) establishes membrane protein topology by cotranslationally partitioning nascent polypeptides into the cytosol, ER lumen, and lipid bilayer. Using photocrosslinking, collisional quenching, cysteine accessibility, and protease protection, we show that a canonical type II signal anchor (SA) acquires its topology through four tightly coupled and mechanistically distinct steps: (1) head-first insertion into Sec61$\alpha$, (2) nascent chain accumulation within the RTC, (3) inversion from type I to type II topology, and (4) stable translocation of C-terminal flanking residues. Progression through each stage is induced by incremental increases in chain length and involves abrupt changes in the molecular environment of the SA. Importantly, type II SA inversion deviates from a type I SA at an unstable intermediate whose topology is controlled by dynamic interactions between the ribosome and translocon. Thus, the RTC coordinates SA topogenesis within a protected environment via sequential energetic transitions of the TM segment.},

To date, most of the pulsed ESR techniques require frozen solutions at cryogenic temperatures to reduce the rapid electron spin relaxation rate and to prevent averaging of electron-electron dipolar interaction due to the rapid molecular tumbling. To enable measurements in liquid solution, we are exploring a triarylmethyl (TAM)-based spin label with a relatively long relaxation time where the protein is immobilized by attachment to a solid support. In this preliminary study, TAM radicals were attached via disulfide linkages to substituted cysteine residues at positions 65 and 80 or 65 and 76 in T4 lysozyme immobilized on Sepharose. Interspin distances determined using double quantum coherence (DQC) in solution are close to those expected from models, and the narrow distance distribution in each case indicates that the TAM-based spin label is relatively localized.},

Inasmuch as bioactivities of cell membranes are known to depend crucially on their lateral organization, much effort has been focused on deciphering this organization on different length scales. Within this context, the concept of lipid rafts has been intensively discussed over recent years. In line with its ability to measure diffusion parameters with great precision, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements have been made in association with innovative experimental strategies to monitor modes of molecular lateral diffusion within the plasma membrane of living cells. These investigations have allowed significant progress in the characterization of the cell membrane lateral organization at the suboptical level and have provided compelling evidence for the in vivo existence of raft nanodomains. We review these FCS-based studies and the characteristic structural features of raft nanodomains. We also discuss the findings in regards to the current view of lipid rafts as a general membrane-organizing principle.},

abstract = {Water molecules in the immediate vicinity of biomolecular surfaces (e.g., protein, lipid membranes, and DNA) are essential to mediate biological activities, such as enzyme activity, ligand binding, allosteric effect, or molecular recognition. For instance, the formation of a functional enzyme-substrate complex may be mediated by the retardation of water mobility at the active site of the enzyme. Hydrated water could also facilitate specific protein function, such as channel gating, whose kinetics has been found to be critically correlated with the rate of water fluctuations. Additionally, water is generally thought to be a catalyst for the hydrogen-bond rearrangements of a protein. The prevailing view is that water molecules actively contribute to the hydrophobic effect involved in protein-folding and ligand-binding events by modulating protein conformational changes through the formation or breaking of hydrogen bonds at protein--water interfaces. Interestingly, the diffusion dynamics of hydration water that entails hydrogen-bond rearrangement of the dynamic protein--water network may be critically coupled to protein dynamics, not only at the interfaces, but also at the core. A combination of the rapid hydrogen-bond rearrangements and the fast hydration dynamics at protein--water interfaces are suggested to be essential in increasing the protein structural flexibility and facilitating protein-ligand recognition.},

We recently demonstrated using pulsed EPR spectroscopy that one of the five oxygen bridges ($\mu$-oxo) exchanges unusually rapidly with bulk water and is thus a likely candidate for one of the substrates. Ammonia, a water analog, was previously shown to bind to the Mn4O5Ca cluster, potentially displacing a water/substrate ligand [Britt RD, et al. (1989) J Am Chem Soc 111(10):3522-3532]. Here we show by a combination of EPR and time-resolved membrane inlet mass spectrometry that the binding of ammonia perturbs the exchangeable $\mu$-oxo bridge without drastically altering the binding/exchange kinetics of the two substrates. In combination with broken-symmetry density functional theory, our results show that (i) the exchangable $\mu$-oxo bridge is O5 {\{}using the labeling of the current crystal structure [Umena Y, et al. (2011) Nature 473(7345):55-60]{\}}; (ii) ammonia displaces a water ligand to the outer manganese (MnA4-W1); and (iii) as W1 is trans to O5, ammonia binding elongates the MnA4-O5 bond, leading to the perturbation of the $\mu$-oxo bridge resonance and to a small change in the water exchange rates. These experimental results support O-O bond formation between O5 and possibly an oxyl radical as proposed by Siegbahn and exclude W1 as the second substrate water.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a recently developed new family of miniature surface resonators, used for electron spin resonance spectroscopy and imaging. The first part of the paper provides a detailed description of the operational principles of the surface resonators. It also includes sensitivity analysis for a variety of configurations with inner dimensions ranging from 150 $\mu$m down to 2 $\mu$m, operating at the Ku, Q, and W frequency bands. Most of the data presented here is based on theoretical predictions; however, some of it is accompanied by experiential results for verification. The second part of the paper describes a new type of double-surface microresonator and its production method. This new configuration enables an efficient coupling of the microwave energy from millimetre-sized microstrip lines to micron structures even at relatively low frequencies. The resonator is analysed both theoretically and experimentally – exhibiting ultra-high spin sensitivity. The conclusion of the two parts of the paper is th...},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess intrinsic properties of water diffusion in normal human brain by using quantitative parameters derived from the diffusion tensor, D, which are insensitive to patient orientation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Maps of the principal diffusivities of D, of Trace(D), and of diffusion anisotropy indices were calculated in eight healthy adults from 31 multisection, interleaved echo-planar diffusion-weighted images acquired in about 25 minutes.

RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in Trace(D) (approximately 2,100 x 10(-6) mm2/sec) were found within normal brain parenchyma, except in the cortex, where Trace(D) was higher. Diffusion anisotropy varied widely among different white matter regions, reflecting differences in fiber-tract architecture. In the corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts, the ratio of parallel to perpendicular diffusivities was approximately threefold higher than previously reported, and diffusion appeared cylindrically symmetric. However, in other white matter regions, particularly in the centrum semiovale, diffusion anisotropy was low, and cylindrical symmetry was not observed. Maps of parameters derived from D were also used to segment tissues based on their diffusion properties.

CONCLUSION: A quantitative characterization of water diffusion in anisotropic, heterogeneously oriented tissues is clinically feasible. This should improve the neuroradiologic assessment of a variety of gray and white matter disorders.},

  abstract  = {The cytolytic peptide melittin is a potential anticancer candidate that may be able to overcome tumor drug resistance due to its lytic properties. However, in vivo applications of melittin are limited due to its main side effect, hemolysis, which is especially pronounced following intravenous administration. Here, we designed a hybrid cytolytic peptide, $\alpha$-melittin, in which the N-terminus of melittin is linked to the C-terminus of an amphipathic $\alpha$-helical peptide ($\alpha$-peptide) via a GSG linker. The strong $\alpha$-helical configuration allows $\alpha$-melittin to interact with phospholipids and self-assemble into lipid nanoparticles, with a high efficiency for $\alpha$-melittin encapsulation ({\textgreater}80{\%}) and a strong ability to control the structure of the nanoparticle ({\~{}}20 nm). This $\alpha$-melittin-based lipid nanoparticle ($\alpha$-melittin-NP) efficiently shields the positive charge of melittin (18.70 ± 0.90 mV) within the phospholipid monolayer, resulting in the generation of a neutral nanoparticle (2.45 ± 0.56 mV) with reduced cytotoxicity and a widened safe dosage range. Confocal imaging data confirmed that $\alpha$-melittin peptides were efficiently released from the nanoparticles and were cytotoxic to the melanoma cells. Finally, $\alpha$-melittin-NPs were administered to melanoma-bearing mice via intravenous injection. The growth of the melanoma cells was blocked by the $\alpha$-melittin-NPs, with an 82.8{\%} inhibition rate relative to the PBS-treated control group. No side effects of treatment were found in this study. Thus, the excellent properties of $\alpha$-melittin-NP give it potential clinical applications in solid tumor therapeutics through intravenous administration.},

Experimental results using pulsed DNP with an aqueous solution of a narrow-linewidth Paramagnetic probe are presented. A maximum DNP enhancement of about -36 with a train of inverting pulses (width 500 ns, repetition time 4 mu s) was measured. A preliminary comparison showed that, when the same enhancement value is considered, the pulsed DNP technique requires an average power that is about three times higher than that required with the CW irradiation. However, for in vivo DNP applications it is very important to minimize the average power deposited in the sample. From the experimental results reported in this work, when considering the maximum enhancement, the pulsed technique requires only 2{\%} of the average power necessary with the CW DNP technique. We believe that this reduction in the average power can be important for future DNP studies with large biological-samples. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The signaling apparatus that controls bacterial chemotaxis is composed of a core complex containing chemoreceptors, the histidine autokinase CheA, and the coupling protein CheW. Site-specific spin labeling and pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy (PDS) have been applied to investigate the structure of a soluble ternary complex formed by Thermotoga maritima CheA (TmCheA), CheW, and receptor signaling domains. Thirty-five symmetric spin-label sites (SLSs) were engineered into the five domains of the CheA dimer and CheW to provide distance restraints within the CheA:CheW complex in the absence and presence of a soluble receptor that inhibits kinase activity (Tm14). Additional PDS restraints among spin-labeled CheA, CheW, and an engineered single-chain receptor labeled at six different sites allow docking of the receptor structure relative to the CheA:CheW complex. Disulfide cross-linking between selectively incorporated Cys residues finds two pairs of positions that provide further constraints within the ternary complex: one involving Tm14 and CheW and another involving Tm14 and CheA. The derived structure of the ternary complex indicates a primary site of interaction between CheW and Tm14 that agrees well with previous biochemical and genetic data for transmembrane chemoreceptors. The PDS distance distributions are most consistent with only one CheW directly engaging one dimeric Tm14. The CheA dimerization domain (P3) aligns roughly antiparallel to the receptor-conserved signaling tip but does not interact strongly with it. The angle of the receptor axis with respect to P3 and the CheW-binding P5 domains is bound by two limits differing by approximately 20 degrees . In one limit, Tm14 aligns roughly along P3 and may interact to some extent with the hinge region near the P3 hairpin loop. In the other limit, Tm14 tilts to interact with the P5 domain of the opposite subunit in an interface that mimics that observed with the P5 homologue CheW. The time domain ESR data can be simulated from the model only if orientational variability is introduced for the P5 and, especially, P3 domains. The Tm14 tip also binds beside one of the CheA kinase domains (P4); however, in both bound and unbound states, P4 samples a broad range of distributions that are only minimally affected by Tm14 binding. The CheA P1 domains that contain the substrate histidine are also broadly distributed in space under all conditions. In the context of the hexagonal lattice formed by trimeric transmembrane chemoreceptors, the PDS structure is best accommodated with the P3 domain in the center of a honeycomb edge.},

This method is well suited and widely used to study small soluble proteins, membrane proteins and large protein complexes. Recent advances in site-directed spin labeling methodology have occurred in two areas. The first involves an understanding of the conformations and local dynamics of the spin-labeled sidechain, including the features of proteins that influence electron paramagnetic resonance lineshape. The second advance is the application of pulse techniques to determine long-range distances and distance distributions in proteins. During the past two years, these technical developments have been used to address several important problems concerning the molecular function of proteins. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Characterizing the hydrophobicity of a protein surface is relevant to understanding and quantifying its interactions with ligands, other proteins, and extended interfaces. However, the hydrophobicity of a complex, heterogeneous protein surface depends not only on the chemistry of the underlying amino acids but also on the precise chemical pattern and topographical context presented by the surface. Characterization of such context-dependent hydrophobicity at nanoscale resolution is a nontrivial task. The free energy, $\mu$(v)(ex), of forming a cavity near a surface has been shown to be a robust measure of context-dependent hydrophobicity, with more favorable $\mu$(v)(ex) values suggesting hydrophobic regions. However, estimating $\mu$(v)(ex) for cavities significantly larger than the size of a methane molecule in a spatially resolved manner near proteins is a computationally daunting task. Here, we present a new method for estimating $\mu$(v)(ex) that is 2 orders of magnitude more efficient than conventional techniques. Our method envisions cavity creation as the emptying of a volume of interest, v, by applying an external potential that is proportional to the number of water molecules, N(v), in v. We show that the "force" to be integrated to obtain $\mu$(v)(ex) is simply the average of N(v) in the presence of the potential, and can be sampled accurately using short simulations (50-100 ps), making our method very efficient. By leveraging the efficiency of the method to calculate $\mu$(v)(ex) at various locations in the hydration shell of the protein, hydrophobin II, we are able to construct a hydrophobicity map of the protein that accounts for topographical and chemical context. Interestingly, we find that the map is also dependent on the shape and size of v, suggesting an "observer context" in mapping the hydrophobicity of protein surfaces.},

  abstract = {Transferring from laboratory frame to off-resonance rotating frame for the (1)H spin can compensate the relaxivity loss for paramagnetic agents at the magnetic field strength higher than 3 Tesla and enhance water relaxation rate constant significantly. A comprehensive theory for calculating the relaxation rate constants in the off-resonance rotating frame is described. This theory considers the contributions from both inner shell and outer shell water. The derived relaxation rate constants and relaxation enhancement efficiency as a function of the magnetic field strength and the effective field parameters are directly correlated to the structures, dynamics and environments of paramagnetic agents. To validate the theoretical predictions, we have measured the relaxation enhancement efficiency for a series of macromolecule conjugated gadolinium chelates at 9.4 Tesla. The experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions. The theory also predicts the relaxation enhancement for T(2)-type paramagnetic agents at high magnetic fields. Promising fields of applications include situations where T(1)- or T(2)-type paramagnetic agents are used for labeling molecular/cellular events.},

abstract = {As the fraction of electricity generation from intermittent renewable sources--such as solar or wind--grows, the ability to store large amounts of electrical energy is of increasing importance. Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully regulate wind or solar power output. In contrast, flow batteries can independently scale the power (electrode area) and energy (arbitrarily large storage volume) components of the system by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form. Wide-scale utilization of flow batteries is, however, limited by the abundance and cost of these materials, particularly those using redox-active metals and precious-metal electrocatalysts. Here we describe a class of energy storage materials that exploits the favourable chemical and electrochemical properties of a family of molecules known as quinones. The example we demonstrate is a metal-free flow battery based on the redox chemistry of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS). AQDS undergoes extremely rapid and reversible two-electron two-proton reduction on a glassy carbon electrode in sulphuric acid. An aqueous flow battery with inexpensive carbon electrodes, combining the quinone/hydroquinone couple with the Br2/Br(-) redox couple, yields a peak galvanic power density exceeding 0.6 W cm(-2) at 1.3 A cm(-2). Cycling of this quinone-bromide flow battery showed {\textgreater}99 per cent storage capacity retention per cycle. The organic anthraquinone species can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals. This organic approach permits tuning of important properties such as the reduction potential and solubility by adding functional groups: for example, we demonstrate that the addition of two hydroxy groups to AQDS increases the open circuit potential of the cell by 11{\%} and we describe a pathway for further increases in cell voltage. The use of $\pi$-aromatic redox-active organic molecules instead of redox-active metals represents a new and promising direction for realizing massive electrical energy storage at greatly reduced cost.},

The case of a nucleus belonging to a paramagnetic ion is examined in some detail with reference to the recent experiment of Honig on arsenic-doped silicon. It is shown that while an Overhauser effect may be expected, this offers no support for an interpretation of Honig's results as a hundred percent nuclear polarization.},

These studies were performed over a range of blends of POPC and POPS and temperatures, utilizing the spin-labeled lipids 16-phosphatidylcholine and 5-phosphatidylcholine as well as cholestane (CSL). The ESR spectra were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares fitting using detailed spectral simulations. Whereas CSL shows almost no variation in ordering and rotational dynamics versus mole fraction POPS, (i.e. XPS), and 5-PC shows small effects, the weakly ordered end-chain labeled 16-PC shows large relative effects, such that the orientational order parameter, S is at a minimum for XPS = 0.5 where it is about one-third the value observed for XPS = 0 and 1. This is directly reflected in the ESR spectrum as a substantial variation in the hyperfine splitting with XPS. The least-squares analysis also shows a reduction in rotational diffusion coefficient, R perpendicular by a fractor of 2 for XPS = 0.5 and permits the estimation of S2, the ordering parameter representing deviations from cylindrically symmetric alignment. These results are contrasted with 2H NMR studies which were insensitive to effects of mixing headgroups on the acyl chains. The ESR results are consistent with a somewhat increased disorder in the end-chain region as well as a small amount of chain tilting upon mixing POPC and POPS. They demonstrate the high sensitivity of ESR to subtle effects in chain ordering and dynamics.},

abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies of nanogap capacitors as potential label free biosensors are presented. The nanogap device is capable of detecting the existence of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides (20-mer) in 100 nM aqueous solutions using a 20 nm gap of 1.2 pl in volume. While the dielectric properties of DNA solution have been widely investigated, early approaches are limited at low frequency by the parasitic noise due to the electrical double layer (EDL) impedance. Nanogap electrodes have the potential to serve as biomolecular junctions because their size (5-100 nm) minimizes electrode polarization effects regardless of frequency. In this paper, we modeled the effects of the EDL interaction between two parallel nanogap electrodes by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for equilibrium state. When the gap size is smaller than the EDL thickness, the dependence of the nanogap capacitance on the ionic strength is insignificant. This is critical in using the capacitance change as an indicator of the existence of target molecules. The predicted capacitance of nanogaps filled with various ionic strength electrolytes was in quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. The various concentrations of the target molecules in nanogap sensor were characterized. A capacitance change of a 20 nm x (10)1.5 microm x 4mm gap from 3.5 to 4.1 nF at 200 Hz was recorded between deionized water (DI) and 100 nM ssDNA solution (about 70,000 molecules inside the gap for equilibrium state).},

Results obtained in DRCOSY experiments show that the diffusion process of dextran 77 kDa exhibits an observation time dependence suggesting a diffusion behavior restricted by confinement. We find evidence for both single capsule and capsule aggregate states, with a partitioning of the 77-kDa dextran between the free and capsule states much larger than that suggested by volume fraction alone. Results from DEXSY experiments show that dextran 77 kDa is in diffusive exchange through the capsules with an exchange time of around 1 s. In contrast, the capsules have no detectable influence on the diffusion process of the dextran 4.4 kDa. This quantitative information may be used in designing PEM capsules as drug carriers.},

Although it has long been known that chaperonin substrates fold upon sequestration inside the chaperonin barrel, the precise mechanism by which confinement within this space facilitates folding remains unknown. We examine the possibility that the chaperonin mediates a favorable reorganization of the solvent for the folding reaction. We discuss the effect of electrostatic charge on solvent-mediated hydrophobic forces in an aqueous environment. Based on these physical arguments, we construct a simple, phenomenological theory for the thermodynamics of density and hydrogen-bond order fluctuations in liquid water. Within the framework of this model, we investigate the effect of confinement inside a chaperonin-like cavity on the configurational free energy of water by calculating solvent free energies for cavities corresponding to the different conformational states in the ATP-driven catalytic cycle of the prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL. Our findings suggest that one function of chaperonins may involve trapping unfolded proteins and subsequently exposing them to a microenvironment in which the hydrophobic effect, a crucial thermodynamic driving force for folding, is enhanced.},

The formation of a polyion-liposome complex driven by the correlated polyion adsorption at the particle surface implies two concomitant effects referred to as reentrant condensation and charge inversion. Both of them are governed by electrostatic interactions and there is now strong evidence, based on experiments and simulations, that counterion release is the driving force of the aggregation process. From this point of view, dielectric technique may offer a suitable tool in the investigation of the structural properties of these aggregates. In spite of the fact that interaction of polyions with oppositely charged surfaces was extensively experimentally investigated, there are no papers concerning the dielectric properties during the polyion-induced aggregation. To get an insight into this important topic, the authors present here an extensive set of radiowave dielectric measurements of liposomal vesicle aqueous suspensions where the liposome aggregation was induced by an oppositely charged polyion. The aggregation was followed from the beginning, when most of the isolated liposomes predominate, up to the formation of polyion-coated liposomes of inverted charge, crossing the isoelectric condition, where large, almost neutral, aggregates appear. The authors describe the observed dielectric dispersions as due to counterion polarization in the adjacency of the liposome and liposome aggregate surface, primarily governed by the zeta potential, according to the standard electrokinetic model.},

We report herein characterization of this synthetic membrane fusion reaction with regard to the following: effects of fusogen concentration, lipid composition, and membrane charge. Our findings indicate that these parameters are determinants of fusion rate, vesicle stability, peptide binding, catalytic fusion and membrane disruption during fusion. Notably, these data indicate the importance of coupling between molecular recognition and insertion for bilayer activation as well as the critical role of membrane subdomain formation for membrane fusion reactivity. These phenomena are general to lipid membrane chemistry, and therefore these findings provide a guideline for understanding more complex biomembrane systems.},

Here we describe the first high-field liquid-state DNP results using a high-power gyrotron microwave source (20 W at 260 GHz). A DNP enhancement of -29 on water protons was obtained for an aqueous solution of Fremy's Salt; in comparison the previous highest value was -10 using a solid-state microwave power source (maximum power 45 mW). The increased enhancements are partly due to larger microwave saturation and elevated sample temperature. These experimentally observed DNP enhancements, which by far exceed the predicted values extrapolated from low-field DNP experiments, demonstrate experimentally that DNP is possible in the liquid state also at high magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a method that permits NMR signal intensities of solids and liquids to be enhanced significantly, and is therefore potentially an important tool in structural and mechanistic studies of biologically relevant molecules. During a DNP experiment, the large polarization of an exogeneous or endogeneous unpaired electron is transferred to the nuclei of interest (I) by microwave (microw) irradiation of the sample. The maximum theoretical enhancement achievable is given by the gyromagnetic ratios (gamma(e)gamma(l)), being approximately 660 for protons. In the early 1950s, the DNP phenomenon was demonstrated experimentally, and intensively investigated in the following four decades, primarily at low magnetic fields. This review focuses on recent developments in the field of DNP with a special emphasis on work done at high magnetic fields ({\textgreater} or =5 T), the regime where contemporary NMR experiments are performed. After a brief historical survey, we present a review of the classical continuous wave (cw) DNP mechanisms-the Overhauser effect, the solid effect, the cross effect, and thermal mixing. A special section is devoted to the theory of coherent polarization transfer mechanisms, since they are potentially more efficient at high fields than classical polarization schemes. The implementation of DNP at high magnetic fields has required the development and improvement of new and existing instrumentation. Therefore, we also review some recent developments in microw and probe technology, followed by an overview of DNP applications in biological solids and liquids. Finally, we outline some possible areas for future developments.},

We evidence the critical importance of the solute concentration in determining the magnitude of the slowdown in water dynamics compared to the bulk situation. The comparison of concentrated aqueous solutions of tetramethylurea, which tends to aggregate, and of trimethylamine N-oxide, which does not, shows the dramatic impact of solute clustering on the water dynamics. No significant decoupling of the reorientation and translation dynamics of water is observed, even at very high solute concentrations. The respective roles of energetic and topological disorders in determining the translational subdiffusive water dynamics in these confining environments are discussed. The water reorientational dynamics is shown to be quantitatively described by an extended jump model which combines two factors determined by the local structure: the transition-state excluded volume and the transition-state hydrogen-bond strength.},

We demonstrate here the potential of a new algorithm for the 2D inverse Laplace transformation of IR-FID-CPMG data based on an adapted reconstruction of the maximum entropy method, combining the standard decreasing exponential decay function with an additional term drawn from Abragam's FID function. The results show that the proposed IR-FID-CPMG sequence and its related inversion model allow accurate characterization and quantification of both solid and liquid phases in multiphasic and compartmentalized systems. Moreover, it permits to distinguish between solid phases having different T1 relaxation times or to highlight cross-relaxation phenomena.},

Crystal structures of V1 at two positions in a helix of T4 Lysozyme and quantum mechanical calculations suggest the source of the constraints as intra-side chain interactions of the disulfide sulfur atoms with both the protein backbone and the 3-nitrogen in the imidazoline ring. These interactions apparently limit the conformation of the side chain to one of only three possible rotamers, two of which are observed in the crystal structure. An inter-spin distance measurement in frozen solution using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) gives a value essentially identical to that determined from the crystal structure of the protein containing two copies of V1, indicating that lattice forces do not dictate the rotamers observed. Collectively, the results suggest the possibility of predetermining a unique rotamer of V1 in helical structures. In general, the reduced rotameric space of V1 compared to R1 should simplify interpretation of inter-spin distance information in terms of protein structure, while the highly constrained internal motion is expected to extend the dynamic range for characterizing large amplitude nanosecond backbone fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Continuous thermometry during a hyperthermic procedure may help to correct for local differences in heat conduction and energy absorption, and thus allow optimization of the thermal therapy. Noninvasive, three-dimensional mapping of temperature changes is feasible with magnetic resonance (MR) and may be based on the relaxation time T(1), the diffusion coefficient (D), or proton resonance frequency (PRF) of tissue water. The use of temperature-sensitive contrast agents and proton spectroscopic imaging can provide absolute temperature measurements. The principles and performance of these methods are reviewed in this paper. The excellent linearity and near-independence with respect to tissue type, together with good temperature sensitivity, make PRF-based temperature MRI the preferred choice for many applications at mid to high field strength ({\textgreater}/= 1 T). The PRF methods employ radiofrequency spoiled gradient-echo imaging methods. A standard deviation of less than 1 degrees C, for a temporal resolution below 1 second and a spatial resolution of about 2 mm, is feasible for a single slice for immobile tissues. Corrections should be made for temperature-induced susceptibility effects in the PRF method. If spin-echo methods are preferred, for example when field homogeneity is poor due to small ferromagnetic parts in the needle, the D- and T(1)-based methods may give better results. The sensitivity of the D method is higher that that of the T(1) methods provided that motion artifacts are avoided and the trace of D is evaluated. Fat suppression is necessary for most tissues when T(1), D, or PRF methods are employed. The latter three methods require excellent registration to correct for displacements between scans.},

  abstract = {In K(+) channels, the selectivity filter, pore helix, and outer vestibule play a crucial role in gating mechanisms. The outer vestibule is an important structurally extended region of KcsA in which toxins, blockers, and metal ions bind and modulate the gating behavior of K(+) channels. Despite its functional significance, the gating-related structural dynamics at the outer vestibule are not well understood. Under steady-state conditions, inactivating WT and noninactivating E71A KcsA stabilize the nonconductive and conductive filter conformations upon opening the activation gate. Site-directed fluorescence polarization of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD)-labeled outer vestibule residues shows that the outer vestibule of open/conductive conformation is highly dynamic compared with the motional restriction experienced by the outer vestibule during inactivation gating. A wavelength-selective fluorescence approach shows a change in hydration dynamics in inactivated and noninactivated conformations, and supports a possible role of restricted/bound water molecules in C-type inactivation gating. Using a unique restrained ensemble simulation method, along with distance measurements by EPR, we show that, on average, the outer vestibule undergoes a modest backbone conformational change during its transition to various functional states, although the structural dynamics of the outer vestibule are significantly altered during activation and inactivation gating. Taken together, our results support the role of a hydrogen bond network behind the selectivity filter, side-chain conformational dynamics, and water molecules in the gating mechanisms of K(+) channels.},

The approach is based on the implicit solvent model including finite sizes of hydrated ions and a dielectric approximation of the ion hydration shell. Results were obtained for the detailed geometry model of B-DNA in dilute and moderately concentrated solutions of NaCl and CaCl(2). All -MPB parameters of ions and dielectric medium were extracted from published results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The study allows evaluations of the ion size, interionic correlation, and the solvent dielectric saturation effects on the ion distributions around DNA. It unambiguously suggests that the difference between the -MPB and Poisson-Boltzmann distributions of ions is low for Na(+) counterions. Such a difference in the case of divalent counterions Ca(2+) is dramatic: the dielectric saturation of the ion hydration shell leads to point-like adsorption of Ca(2+) on the phosphate groups of DNA. The -MPB equations were also applied to calculate the energy of interaction between two B-DNA molecules. Results agree with previously published simulations and experimental data. Some aspects of ion specificity of polyelectrolyte properties are discussed.},

abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate a highly antifouling thin-film composite (TFC) membrane by grafting a zwitterionic polymer brush via atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ATRP), a controlled, environmentally benign chemical process. Initiator molecules for polymerization were immobilized on the membrane surface by bioinspired catechol chemistry, leading to the grafting of a dense zwitterionic polymer brush layer. Surface characterization revealed that the modified membrane exhibits reduced surface roughness, enhanced hydrophilicity, and lower surface charge. Chemical force microscopy demonstrated that the modified membrane displayed foulant-membrane interaction forces that were 1 order of magnitude smaller than those of the pristine TFC membrane. The excellent fouling resistance imparted by the zwitterionic brush layer was further demonstrated by significantly reduced adsorption of proteins and bacteria. In addition, forward osmosis fouling experiments with a feed solution containing a mixture of organic foulants (bovine-serum albumin, alginate, and natural organic matter) indicated that the modified membrane exhibited significantly lower water flux decline compared to the pristine TFC membrane. The controlled architecture of the zwitterionic polymer brush via ATRP has the potential for a facile antifouling modification of a wide range of water treatment membranes without compromising intrinsic transport properties.},

The central carbon atom carrying most of the unpaired electron spin density is surrounded by the sulfur atoms in the radical and is completely shielded from solvent.

We quantify the free energy of adsorption, conformational equilibria, and translational and conformational dynamics of the polymer at these diverse interfaces. Water-mediated interactions drive the polymer to adsorb strongly at a hydrophobic interface and repel it from hydrophilic ones. At hydrophilic surfaces, van der Waals interactions between the polymer and the surface mitigate this water-mediated repulsion, leading to weak adsorption of the polymer. Although the polymer is strongly adsorbed to hydrophobic surfaces, it is also most dynamic there. Translational diffusion and conformational dynamics are faster at hydrophobic surfaces compared to those at hydrophilic ones. In bulk water, the polymer collapses into compact globular shapes, whereas the thermodynamic stability of folded polymers is significantly lowered at hydrophobic surfaces. The polymer spreads into pancake-like 2D conformations at hydrophobic surfaces and gradually beads up into globular shapes as the surface is made more hydrophilic. Interestingly, the binding thermodynamics and dynamics correlate with macroscopic droplet contact angles that characterize the wetting properties of the different interfaces.},

Successful theories predict a drying transition leading to a vapor-like region near large hard-sphere solutes and interfaces. Adding attractions wets the interface with local density increasing with attractions. Here we present extensive molecular simulation studies of hydration of realistic surfaces with a wide range of chemistries from hydrophobic (-CF(3), -CH(3)) to hydrophilic (-OH, -CONH(2)). We show that the water density near weakly attractive hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., -CF(3)) can be bulk-like or larger, and provides a poor quantification of surface hydrophobicity. In contrast, the probability of cavity formation or the free energy of binding of hydrophobic solutes to interfaces correlates quantitatively with the macroscopic wetting properties and serves as an excellent signature of hydrophobicity. Specifically, the probability of cavity formation is enhanced in the vicinity of hydrophobic surfaces, and water-water correlations correspondingly display characteristics similar to those near a vapor-liquid interface. Hydrophilic surfaces suppress cavity formation and reduce the water-water correlation length. Our results suggest a potentially robust approach for characterizing hydrophobicity of more complex and heterogeneous surfaces of proteins and biomolecules, and other nanoscopic objects.},

abstract = {An advance in the problem of achieving broadband, selective, and uniform-phase excitation in NMR spectroscopy of liquids is outlined. Broadband means that, neglecting relaxation, any frequency bandwidth may be excited even when the available radiofrequency (RF) field strength is strictly limited. Selective means that sharp transition edges can be created between pure-phase excitation and no excitation at all. Uniform phase means that, neglecting spin-spin coupling, all resonance lines have nearly the same phase. Conventional uniform-phase excitation pulses (e.g., E-BURP), mostly based on amplitude modulation of the RF field, are not broadband: they have an achievable bandwidth that is strictly limited by the peak power available. Other compensated pulses based on adiabatic half-passage, like BIR-4, are not selective. By contrast, inversion pulses based on adiabatic fast passage can be broadband (and selective) in the sense above. The advance outlined is a way to reformulate these frequency modulated (FM) pulses for excitation, rather than just inversion.},

A commonly used nitroxide side chain (R1), or a methylated analogue with hindered internal motion (R2), was substituted for the native side chain at solvent-exposed helical sites, 72 or 131. The spectra at all four frequencies were simultaneously fit with the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) model. Good fits were achieved at all the temperatures. Two principle dynamic modes are included in the SRLS model, the global tumbling of the protein and the internal motion consisting of backbone fluctuations and side chain isomerizations. Three distinct spectral components were required for R1 and two for R2 to account for the spectra at all temperatures. One is a highly ordered and slow motional component, which is observed in the spectra of both R1 and R2; it may correspond to conformers stabilized by interaction with the protein surface. The fraction of this component decreases with increasing temperature and is more populated in the R2 spectra, possibly arising from stronger interaction of the nitroxide ring with the protein surface due to the additional methyl group. The other two components of R1 and the second component of R2 are characterized by fast anisotropic diffusion and relatively low ordering, most likely corresponding to conformers having little or no interactions with nearby residues. Ficoll of different concentrations was added to increase the solution viscosity, thereby slowing down the global tumbling of the protein. A significant effect of Ficoll on the internal motion of an immobilized component was apparent in R2 but not in R1. The ability of such multifrequency studies to separate the effects of faster internal modes of motion from slower overall motions is clearly demonstrated, and its utility in future studies is considered.},

  abstract  = {Beta-azidoalanine dipeptide 1 was synthesized, and its azido stretching vibration in H2O and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was studied by using Fourier transform (FT) IR spectroscopy. The dipole strength of the azido stretch mode is found to be about 19 and 5 times larger than those of the CN and SCN stretch modes, respectively, which have been used as local environmental IR sensors. The azido stretch band in H2O is blue-shifted by about 14 cm(-1) in comparison to that in DMSO, indicative of its sensitivity to the electrostatic environment. To test the utility of beta-azidoalanine as an IR probe of the local electrostatic environment in proteins, azidopeptide 4 was prepared by its incorporation into Abeta(16-22) peptide of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta-protein at position Ala21. The amide I IR spectrum of 4 in D2O suggests that the azidopeptide thus modified forms in-register beta-sheets in aggregates as observed for normal Abeta(16-22). The azido peak frequency of 4 in aggregates is almost identical to that in DMSO, indicating that the azido group is not exposed to water but to the hydrophobic environment. We believe that beta-azidoalanine will be used as an effective IR probe for providing site-specific information about the local electrostatic environments of proteins.},

Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) stands out in this regard because of its high speed and low illumination intensities, but typically offers only a twofold resolution gain. We extended the resolution of live-cell SIM through two approaches: ultrahigh numerical aperture SIM at 84-nanometer lateral resolution for more than 100 multicolor frames, and nonlinear SIM with patterned activation at 45- to 62-nanometer resolution for approximately 20 to 40 frames. We applied these approaches to image dynamics near the plasma membrane of spatially resolved assemblies of clathrin and caveolin, Rab5a in early endosomes, and -actinin, often in relationship to cortical actin. In addition, we examined mitochondria, actin, and the Golgi apparatus dynamics in three dimensions.},

Phys. 102, 8011 (1995)] that extracts the complex frequencies $\omega$ k and amplitudes d k from a signal C(t)=∑ k d k e −it$\omega$ k in a small frequency interval by recasting the harmonic inversion problem as the one of a small matrix diagonalization. The present methods are rigorously adapted to the conventional case of the signal available on a sparse equidistant time grid and use a more efficient boxlike filter. Various applications are discussed, such as iterative diagonalization of large Hamiltonian matrices for calculating bound and resonance states, scattering calculations in the presence of narrow resonances, etc. For the scattering problem the harmonic inversion is directly applied to the signal c n =($\chi$ f ,T n (Ĥ)$\chi$ i ), generated by the dynamical system governed by a modified Chebyshev recursion, avoiding the usual recasting the problem to the time domain. Some challenging numerical examples are presented. The general filter-diagonalization method is shown to be stable and efficient for the extraction of thousands of complex frequencies $\omega$ k and amplitudes d k from a signal. When the model signal is “spoiled” by a moderate amount of an additive Gaussian noise the obtained spectral estimate is still superior to the conventional Fourier spectrum.},

abstract = {1H high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the solvent environments in a series of poly(phenylene)- and poly(phenylene alkylene)-based anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Multiple water and methanol environments were resolved in the membranes under HRMAS NMR. This allowed the self-diffusion rate constants to be evaluated for each different solvent environment as a function of the membrane identity, ion exchange capacity, water content, and sample temperature. These ionomers have been designed to function as binders within the catalyst layers of direct methanol fuel cells. In such applications, it is desirable to maximize the diffusion of the fuel (methanol) as well as the solvated ions to increase power output. To that end, the flexibilities of the backbone and the cationic side chains have been varied with the expectation that greater polymer mobility will lead to improved permeability.

Here, we examine rotational diffusion in four small, globular proteins (ubiquitin, binase, lysozyme, and fragment B3 of protein G) with the TIP3P, TIP4P/EW, and SPC/E water models, in simulations that are 6 to 60 times as long as the mean rotational tumbling time. We describe a method for extracting diffusion tensors from such simulations and compare the results to experimental values extracted from NMR relaxation measurements. The simulation results accurately follow a diffusion equation, even for spherical harmonic correlation functions with l as large as 8. However, the best-fit tensors are significantly different from experiment, especially for the commonly used TIP3P water model. Simulations that are 20 to 100 times longer than the rotational tumbling times are needed for good statistics. A number of residues exhibit internal motions on the nanosecond time scale, but in all cases examined here, a product of internal and overall time-correlation functions matches the total time-correlation function well.},

Operating in the wavelet domain enables one to perform these operations progressively in a coarse-to-fine fashion, operate on different resolutions, manipulate features at different scales, trade off accuracy for speed, and localize the operation in both the spatial and the frequency domains. Performing such operations in the wavelet domain and then reconstructing the result is also often more efficient than performing the same operation in the standard direct fashion. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability and advantages of this framework to three common types of image operations: image blending, 3D warping of images and sequences, and convolution of images and image sequences.},

The high-field EPR spectra at 249.9 GHz are well into the high-field limit leading to a considerable simplification of the spectra and their interpretation. Three magnetically inequivalent, but physically equivalent, Mn(2+) ions with their respective magnetic Z-axes oriented along the crystallographic [100], [010], [001] axes were observed. Simultaneous fitting of EPR line positions observed at X-, Q-, and far infra-red bands was performed using a least-squares procedure and matrix diagonalization to estimate accurately the Mn(2+) spin-Hamiltonian parameters. The temperature variation of the linewidth and peak-to-peak intensities of the EPR lines indicate the presence of lambda-transitions in the mixed NH(4)Cl(0.9)I(0.1) crystal at 242 and 228 K consistent with those observed in the pure NH(4)Cl and NH(4)I crystals, respectively. A superposition-model analysis of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters reveals that the local environment of the Mn(2+) ion is considerably reorganized to produce axially symmetric crystal fields about the respective Z-axes of the three magnetically inequivalent ions as a consequence of the vacancy created due to charge-compensation when the divalent Mn(2+) ion substitutes for a monovalent NH(4)(+) ion in the NH(4)Cl(0.9)I(0.1) crystal. This reorganization is almost the same as that observed in NH(4)Cl and NH(4)I single crystals, although the latter two are characterized by different, simple cubic and face-centered cubic, structures.},

  abstract = {At 8.5 T, the polarization of an ensemble of electron spins is essentially 100{\%} at 2 K, and decreases to 30{\%} at 20 K. The strong temperature dependence of the electron spin polarization between 2 and 20 K leads to the phenomenon of spin bath quenching: temporal fluctuations of the dipolar magnetic fields associated with the energy-conserving spin "flip-flop" process are quenched as the temperature of the spin bath is lowered to the point of nearly complete spin polarization. This work uses pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 240 GHz to investigate the effects of spin bath quenching on the phase memory times (T(M)) of randomly-distributed ensembles of nitroxide molecules below 20 K at 8.5 T. For a given electron spin concentration, a characteristic, dipolar flip-flop rate (W) is extracted by fitting the temperature dependence of T(M) to a simple model of decoherence driven by the spin flip-flop process. In frozen solutions of 4-Amino-TEMPO, a stable nitroxide radical in a deuterated water-glass, a calibration is used to quantify average spin-spin distances as large as r=6.6 nm from the dipolar flip-flop rate. For longer distances, nuclear spin fluctuations, which are not frozen out, begin to dominate over the electron spin flip-flop processes, placing an effective ceiling on this method for nitroxide molecules. For a bulk solution with a three-dimensional distribution of nitroxide molecules at concentration n, we find W∝n∝1/r(3), which is consistent with magnetic dipolar spin interactions. Alternatively, we observe W∝n(32) for nitroxides tethered to a quasi two-dimensional surface of large ({\O}∼200 nm), unilamellar, lipid vesicles, demonstrating that the quantification of spin bath quenching can also be used to discern the geometry of molecular assembly or organization.},

  abstract = {The combination of high-field electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) techniques employing nitroxide radicals has turned out to be particularly powerful in revealing subtle changes of the polarity and proticity profiles in proteins enbedded in membranes. This information can be obtained by orientation-selective high-field EPR resolving principal components of the nitroxide Zeeman (g) and hyperfine ( A) tensors of the spin labels attached to specific molecular sites. In contrast to the g- and A-tensors, the (14)N ( I = 1) quadrupole interaction tensor of the nitroxide spin label has not been exploited in EPR for probing effects of the microenvironment of functional protein sites. In this work it is shown that the W-band (95 GHz) high-field electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) method is well suited for determining with high accuracy the (14)N quadrupole tensor principal components of a nitroxide spin label in disordered frozen solution. By W-band ESEEM the quadrupole components of a five-ring pyrroline-type nitroxide radical in glassy ortho-terphenyl and glycerol solutions have been determined. This radical is the headgroup of the MTS spin label widely used in SDSL protein studies. By DFT calulations and W-band ESEEM experiments it is demonstrated that the Q(yy) value is especially sensitive to the proticity and polarity of the nitroxide environment in H-bonding and nonbonding situations. The quadrupole tensor is shown to be rather insensitive to structural variations of the nitroxide label itself. When using Q(yy) as a testing probe of the environment, its ruggedness toward temperature changes represents an important advantage over the g xx and A(zz) parameters which are usually employed for probing matrix effects on the spin labeled molecular site. Thus, beyond measurenments of g xx and A(zz) of spin labeled protein sites in disordered solids, W-band high-field ESEEM studies of (14)N quadrupole interactions open a new avenue to reliably probe subtle environmental effects on the electronic structure. This is a significant step forward on the way to differentiate between effects from matrix polarity and hydrogen-bond formation.},

Despite the important role of TMAO as osmoprotectant, the mechanism behind TMAO's action has remained elusive. Here, we study the interaction between urea, TMAO, and water in solution using broadband (100 MHz-1.6 THz) dielectric spectroscopy. We find that the previously reported tight hydrogen bonds between 3 water molecules and the hydrophilic amine oxide group of TMAO, remain intact at all investigated concentrations of urea, showing that no significant hydrogen bonding occurs between the two co-solutes. Despite the absence of direct TMAO-urea interactions, the solute reorientation times of urea and TMAO show an anomalous nonlinear increase with concentration, for ternary mixtures containing equal amounts of TMAO and urea. The nonlinear increase of the reorientation correlates with changes in the viscosity, showing that the combination of TMAO and urea cooperatively enhances the hydrogen-bond structure of the ternary solutions. This nonlinear increase is indicative of water mediated interaction between the two solutes and is not observed if urea is combined with other amphiphilic solutes.},

Two other hydrogen bonds between the vanadate and the protein are made by nitrogen NE2 of glutamine-11 and by the amide nitrogen of phenylalanine-120. The observed geometry of the complex may necessitate reinterpretation of the mechanism of action of RNase.},

In this chapter a reproducible methodology for large-scale protein production applicable to a diverse set of proteins is described. The approach is based on protein expression in E. coli as a fusion with a cleavable affinity tag that was tested on over 20,000 proteins. Specifically, a protocol for fermentation of large quantities of native proteins in disposable culture vessels is presented. A modified protocol that allows for the production of selenium-labeled proteins in defined media is also offered. Finally, a method for the purification of His6-tagged proteins on immobilized metal affinity chromatography columns that generates high-purity material is described in detail.},

In these experiments, H-1 enhancements of up to 170 +/- 50 have been observed in I-C-13-glycine dispersed in a 60:40 glycerol/water matrix at temperatures of 20 K; in addition, we have observed significant enhancements in N-15 spectra of unoriented pf1-bacteriophage. Finally, enhancements of similar to17 have been obtained in two-dimensional C-13-C-13 chemical shift correlation spectra of the amino acid U-C-13, N-15-proline during magic angle spinning (MAS), demonstrating the stability of the DNP experiment for sustained acquisition and for quantitative experiments incorporating dipolar recoupling. In all cases, we have exploited the thermal mixing DNP mechanism with the nitroxide radical 4-amino-TEMPO as the paramagnetic dopant. These are the highest frequency DNP experiments performed to date and indicate that significant signal enhancements can be realized using the thermal mixing mechanism even at elevated magnetic fields. In large measure, this is due to the high microwave power output of the 250 GHz gyrotron oscillator used in these experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

This length scale can be accessed by distance measurements between spin labels if pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques such as electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) and double-quantum EPR are used. The approach does not require crystalline samples and is well suited to biomacromolecules with an intrinsic flexibility as distributions of distances can be measured. Furthermore, oligomerization or complexation of biomacromolecules can also be studied, even if it is incomplete. The sensitivity of the technique and the reliability of the measured distance distribution depend on careful optimization of the experimental conditions and procedures for data analysis. Interpretation of spin-to-spin distance distributions in terms of the structure of the biomacromolecules furthermore requires a model for the conformational distribution of the spin labels.},

At about 8 mM SDS and about 12 mM LiDS concns., the presence of polymer provided more hydrophobic environment for 16-DS and this indicated that the location of the polymer was within the interface region.

However, the protein surface comprises hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches, and understanding the impact of such a chemical heterogeneity on protein self-assembly in water is of fundamental interest. Here, we report structural and thermodynamic investigations on the dimer formation of full-length amyloid-$\beta$ proteins in water associated with Alzheimer's disease. Spontaneous dimerization process--from the individual diffusive regime at large separations, through the approach stage in which two proteins come close to each other, to the structural adjustment stage toward compact dimer formation--was captured in full atomic detail via unguided, explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. The integral-equation theory of liquids was then applied to simulated protein structures to analyze hydration thermodynamic properties and the water-mediated interaction between proteins. We demonstrate that hydrophilic residues play a key role in initiating the dimerization process. A long-range hydration force of enthalpic origin acting on the hydrophilic residues provides the major thermodynamic force that drives two proteins to approach from a large separation to a contact distance. After two proteins make atomic contacts, the nature of the water-mediated interaction switches from a long-range enthalpic attraction to a short-range entropic one. The latter acts both on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Along with the direct protein-protein interactions that lead to the formation of intermonomer hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, the water-mediated attraction of entropic origin brings about structural adjustment of constituent monomer proteins toward the formation of a compact dimer structure.},

The change in free volume with water content displays a transition at $\lambda$ = 4. Limiting water self-diffusivity in Nafion was determined by pulsed gradient spin echo NMR at long delay times. The limiting self-diffusivity increases exponentially with water activity; the rate of increase of diffusivity with water content shows a transition at $\lambda$ = 4. The tortuosity of the hydrophilic domains in Nafion decreased from 20 at low membrane water activity to 3 at $\lambda$ = 4. It suggested a change in the connectivity of the hydrophilic domains absorbed water occurs at $\lambda$ ∼ 4. The diffusivity results were employed to separate the contributions of diffusional and interfacial resistance for water transport across Nafion membranes, which enabled the determination of the interfacial mass transport coefficients. A diffusion model was developed which incorporated activity-dependent diffusivity, volume expansion, and the interfacial resistance, and was used to resolve the water activity profiles in the membrane.},

Digital down-conversion produced baseband signals in quadrature with very precise orthogonality. Real-time resonator tuning was performed by monitoring the Fourier transforms of signals reflected from the resonator during frequency sweeps generated by the AWG. The capabilities of the system were demonstrated by rapid magnetic field scans at 256 MHz carrier frequency, and FID and spin echo experiments at 1 and 10 GHz carrier frequencies. For the rapid scan experiments the leakage through a cross-loop resonator was compensated by adjusting the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid at the carrier frequency that was generated with another AWG channel.},

Overhauser DNP in the solution state can map out the local and site-specific hydration dynamics landscape of membrane proteins and lipid membranes, critically complementing the structural and dynamics information obtained by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

  abstract  = {A microwave temperature-jump nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) system suitable for aqueous solutions has been developed. A microwave pulse of a desired length is generated at a frequency of 2.46 GHz from a 1.3 kW magnetron, and is delivered through a waveguide and a coaxial cable to a coupling loop which works as an antenna to the dielectricresonator in the NMR probe. Inside the dielectricresonator, the microwave power is efficiently absorbed by the sample solution (about 100 $\mu$l) contained in a glass tube, causing a temperature jump by about 25 °C in less than 20 ms. The temperature after the jump can be maintained by applying intermittent microwave pulses of shorter length. A saddle-type radio-frequency coil is placed around the sample tube inside the hollow of the dielectricresonator to excite spins and detect NMR signals. Both the microwave pulses and the radio-frequency pulses are gated by a pulse programmer of the NMRspectrometer to form a desired temperature-jump pulse sequence. A mechanical mixing device is introduced, which significantly reduces the temperature gradient of the sample solution well within 100 ms after the jump. Application to an aqueous solution of ribonuclease A showed that the protein unfolds within 20 ms of microwave heating.},

abstract = {The influence of electric surface charges on the polar headgroups and the hydrocarbon region of phospholipid membranes was studied by mixing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) with charged amphiphiles. A positive surface charge was generated with dialkyldimethylammonium salts and a negative surface charge with dialkyl phosphates. The POPC:amphiphile ratio and hence the surface charge density could be varied over a large range since stable liquid-crystalline bilayers were obtained even for the pure amphiphiles in water. POPC was selectively deuterated at both methylene segments of the choline moiety and at the cis double bond of the oleic acyl chain. Additional experiments were carried out with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine labeled at the C-2 position of the glycerol backbone. Deuterium, phosphorus, and nitrogen-14 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded for liquid-crystalline bilayers with varying concentrations of amphiphiles. Although the hydrocarbon region and the glycerol backbone were not significantly influenced by the addition of amphiphiles, very large perturbations of the phosphocholine headgroup were observed. Qualitatively, these results were similar to those observed previously with other cationic and anionic molecules and suggest that the electric surface charge is the essential driving force in changing the phospholipid headgroup orientation and conformation. While the P-N dipole is approximately parallel to the membrane surface in the pure phospholipid membrane, the addition of a positively charged amphiphile or the binding of cationic molecules moves the N+ end of the dipole toward the water phase, changing the orientation of the phosphate segment by more than 30 degrees at the highest amphiphile concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In a Src-inducible model of cellular transformation, metformin inhibits the earliest known step in the process, activation of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-$\kappa$B. Metformin strongly delays cellular transformation in a manner similar to that occurring upon a weaker inflammatory stimulus. Conversely, inhibition of transformation does not occur if metformin is added after the initial inflammatory stimulus. The antitransformation effect of metformin can be bypassed by overexpression of Lin28B or IL1$\beta$, downstream targets of NF-$\kappa$B. Metformin preferentially inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-$\kappa$B and phosphorylation of STAT3 in cancer stem cells compared with non-stem cancer cells in the same population. The ability of metformin to block tumor growth and prolong remission in xenografts in combination with doxorubicin is associated with decreased function of the inflammatory feedback loop. Lastly, metformin-based combinatorial therapy is effective in xenografts involving inflammatory prostate and melanoma cell lines, whereas it is ineffective in noninflammatory cell lines from these lineages. Taken together, our observations suggest that metformin inhibits a signal transduction pathway that results in an inflammatory response. As metformin alters energy metabolism in diabetics, we speculate that metformin may block a metabolic stress response that stimulates the inflammatory pathway associated with a wide variety of cancers.},

Remotely enhanced liquids for image contrast (RELIC) utilizes a H-1 signal of water that is enhanced outside the sample in continuous-flow mode and immediately delivered to the sample to obtain maximum contrast between entering and bulk fluids. Hyperpolarization suggests an ideal contrast mechanism to highlight the ubiquitous and specific function of water in physiology, biology, and materials because the physiological, chemical, and macroscopic function of water is not altered by the degree of magnetization. We present an approach that is capable of instantaneously enhancing the H-1 MR1 signal by up to 2 orders of magnitude through the overhauser effect under ambient conditions at 0.35 tesla by using highly spin-polarized unpaired electrons that are covalently immobilized onto a porous, water-saturated gel matrix. The continuous polarization of radical free flowing water allowed us to distinctively visualize vortices in model reactors and dispersion patterns through porous media. A H-1 signal enhancement of water by a factor of -10 and -100 provides for an observation time of {\textgreater} 4 and 7 s, respectively, upon its injection into fluids with a T-1 relaxation time of {\textgreater} 1.5 s. The implications for chemical engineering or biomedical applications of using hyperpolarized solvents or physiological fluids to visualize mass transport and perfusion with high and authentic MRI contrast originating from water itself, and not from foreign contrast agents, are immediate.},

abstract = {We present the first study of quantifying the diffusion coefficient of interfacial water on polyelectrolyte surfaces of systems fully dispersed in bulk water under ambient conditions. Such measurements were made possible through the implementation of a recently introduced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) technique to selectively amplify the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal of hydration water that is interacting with specifically located spin labels on polyelectrolyte surfaces. The merit of this novel capability is demonstrated in this report through the measurement of solvent microvisosity on the surface of two types of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, when freely dissolved versus when complexed to form a liquid-liquid colloidal phase called complex coacervates. These complex coacervates were formed through electrostatic complexation between the imidazole-based cationic homopolymer poly(N-vinylimidazole) (PVIm), and anionic polypeptide polyaspartate (PAsp) in the pH range of 4.5 - 6.0, under which conditions the coacervate droplets are highly fluidic yet densely packed with polyelectrolytes. We also investigated the rotational diffusion coefficients of the spin labels covalently bound to the polyelectrolyte chains for both PVIm and PAsp, showing a 5 fold change in the rotational correlation time as well as anisotropy parameter upon coacervation, which represents a surprisingly small decrease given the high polymer concentration inside the dense microdroplets. For both DNP and ESR experiments, the polymers were covalently tagged with stable nitroxide radical spin labels (∼1 wt {\%}) to probe the local solvent and polymer segment dynamics. We found that the surface water diffusion coefficients near uncomplexed PVIm and PAsp at pH 8 differ, and are around D∼1.3×10(-9)m(2) / s. In contrast, inside the complex coacervate phase, the water diffusion coefficient in the immediate vicinity of either polyelectrolyte was D∼ 0.25×10(-9)m(2) / s, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than the bulk water self diffusion coefficient, and yet orders of magnitude greater than that of associated, bound, hydration water. This observation suggests the existence of measurable water inside complex coacervates with relatively high diffusion and exchange dynamics, implying that water moves in nanometer-scale pore spaces as opposed to being structurally bound or even absent. We infer from our observation that the PVIm and PAsp chains are undergoing roughly pairwise association, so that largely charge neutralized species compose the concentrated, yet fluidic and partially hydrated coacervate cores.},

In this report we show that the minor capsid protein L2 is required for egress of viral genomes from endosomes but not for initial uptake and uncoating and that a 23-amino-acid peptide at the C terminus of L2 is necessary for this function. Pseudogenomes encapsidated by L1 and L2 lacking this peptide accumulated in vesicular compartments similar to that observed with L1-only viral particles, and these mutant pseudoviruses were noninfectious. This L2 peptide displayed strong membrane-disrupting activity, induced cytolysis of bacteria and eukaryotic cells in a pH-dependent manner, and permeabilized cells after exogenous addition. Fusions between green fluorescent protein and the L2 peptide integrated into cellular membranes like the wild type but not like C-terminal mutants of L2. Our data indicate that the L2 C terminus facilitates escape of viral genomes from the endocytic compartment and that this feature is conserved among papillomaviruses. Furthermore, the characteristic of this peptide differs from the classical virus-encoded membrane-penetrating peptides.},

Despite extensive efforts, the resolution of this method is limited ({\textgreater}10 microm for short acquisition times), and thus cannot answer many key questions in these fields. We show, through theoretical prediction and initial experiments, that ESR microscopy, although much less developed, can improve upon the resolution limits of NMR, and successfully undertake the 1 mum resolution challenge. Our theoretical predictions demonstrate that existing ESR technology, along with advanced imaging probe design (resonator and gradient coils), using solutions of narrow linewidth radicals (the trityl family), should yield 64 x 64 pixels 2D images (with z slice selection) with a resolution of 1 x 1 x 10 microm at approximately 60 GHz in less than 1h of acquisition. Our initial imaging results, conducted by CW ESR at X-band, support these theoretical predictions and already improve upon the previously reported state-of-the-art for 2D ESR image resolution achieving approximately 10 x 10 mum, in just several minutes of acquisition time. We analyze how future progress, which includes improved resonators, increased frequency of measurement, and advanced pulsed techniques, should achieve the goal of micron resolution.},

  abstract = {The effects of water confinement on hydrogen bond dynamics and hydrogen bond exchange have been analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations for a series of different sizes of spherical nanopores of ionic, nonionic, and hydrophobic interfaces. We have calculated translational diffusion residence times, orientational decay time constants, the infrared spectra, correlation functions describing the hydrogen bond network, the hydrogen bond exchange time and rate constant, and ensemble averages of the hydrogen bond exchange reaction coordinate. We focus on the interfacial layer and bulklike interior of these small water containing nanostructures. Our results indicate a universal slowdown in rotational and hydrogen bond dynamics at the interface relative to bulk water. The interiors of nanopores with highly charged interfaces undergo qualitatively different dynamics than those in other nanopores. The rotational jump hydrogen bond exchange mechanism is shown to be robust and universal, even for this variety of interfaces. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the role of confinement vs interface structure on water dynamics in nanopores.},

@article{Remsing2015,
abstract = {Liquid water can become metastable with respect to its vapor in hydrophobic confinement. The resulting dewetting transitions are often impeded by large kinetic barriers. According to macroscopic theory, such barriers arise from the free energy required to nucleate a critical vapor tube that spans the region between two hydrophobic surfaces - tubes with smaller radii collapse, whereas larger ones grow to dry the entire confined region. Using extensive molecular simulations of water between two nanoscopic hydrophobic surfaces, in conjunction with advanced sampling techniques, here we show that for inter-surface separations that thermodynamically favor dewetting, the barrier to dewetting does not correspond to the formation of a (classical) critical vapor tube. Instead, it corresponds to an abrupt transition from an isolated cavity adjacent to one of the confining surfaces to a gap-spanning vapor tube that is already larger than the critical vapor tube anticipated by macroscopic theory. Correspondingly, the barrier to dewetting is also smaller than the classical expectation. We show that the peculiar nature of water density fluctuations adjacent to extended hydrophobic surfaces - namely, the enhanced likelihood of observing low-density fluctuations relative to Gaussian statistics - facilitates this non-classical behavior. By stabilizing isolated cavities relative to vapor tubes, enhanced water density fluctuations thus stabilize novel pathways, which circumvent the classical barriers and offer diminished resistance to dewetting. Our results thus suggest a key role for fluctuations in speeding up the kinetics of numerous phenomena ranging from Cassie-Wenzel transitions on superhydrophobic surfaces, to hydrophobically-driven biomolecular folding and assembly.},

  abstract = {Despite tremendous advances in recent years, solution NMR remains fundamentally restricted due to its inherent insensitivity. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) potentially offers significant improvements in this respect. The basic DNP strategy is to irradiate the EPR transitions of a stable radical and transfer this nonequilibrium polarization to the hydrogen spins of water, which will in turn transfer polarization to the hydrogens of the macromolecule. Unfortunately, these EPR transitions lie in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum where bulk water absorbs strongly, often resulting in catastrophic heating. Furthermore, the residence times of water on the surface of the protein in bulk solution are generally too short for efficient transfer of polarization. Here we take advantage of the properties of solutions of encapsulated proteins dissolved in low viscosity solvents to implement DNP in liquids. Such samples are largely transparent to the microwave frequencies required and thereby avoid significant heating. Nitroxide radicals are introduced into the reverse micelle system in three ways: attached to the protein, embedded in the reverse micelle shell, and free in the aqueous core. Significant enhancements of the water resonance ranging up to {\$}{\~{}}{\$}-93 at 0.35 T were observed. We also find that the hydration properties of encapsulated proteins allow for efficient polarization transfer from water to the protein. These and other observations suggest that merging reverse micelle encapsulation technology with DNP offers a route to a significant increase in the sensitivity of solution NMR spectroscopy of proteins and other biomolecules.},

abstract = {We present a coarse-grained modeling approach that spans the nanosecond- to minute-timescale dynamics of cotranslational protein translocation. The method enables direct simulation of both integral membrane protein topogenesis and transmembrane domain (TM) stop-transfer efficiency. Simulations reveal multiple kinetic pathways for protein integration, including a mechanism in which the nascent protein undergoes slow-timescale reorientation, or flipping, in the confined environment of the translocon channel. Competition among these pathways gives rise to the experimentally observed dependence of protein topology on ribosomal translation rate and protein length. We further demonstrate that sigmoidal dependence of stop-transfer efficiency on TM hydrophobicity arises from local equilibration of the TM across the translocon lateral gate, and it is predicted that slowing ribosomal translation yields decreased stop-transfer efficiency in long proteins. This work reveals the balance between equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes in protein targeting, and it provides insight into the molecular regulation of the Sec translocon.},

This is achieved in the time domain after two efficient numerical integrators are developed: One for the quantal dynamics of the spins and the other for the classical rotational diffusion. For the quantal dynamics, we propagate the relevant part of the spin density matrix in Hilbert space. For the diffusional tumbling, we work with quaternions, which enables the treatment of anisotropic diffusion in a potential expanded as a sum of spherical harmonics. Time-averaging arguments are invoked to bridge the gap between the smaller time step of the MD trajectories and the larger time steps appropriate for the rotational diffusion and/or quantal spin dynamics.},

Using solid-state NMR, researchers have studied potassium channels, proton channels, Ca(2+) pumps, G protein-coupled receptors, bacterial outer membrane proteins, and viral fusion proteins to elucidate their mechanisms of action. Many of these membrane proteins have also been investigated in detergent micelles using solution NMR.

It discusses also the challenges of in vivo spectroscopy and imaging and presents information about new developments such as longitudinally detected EPR (LODEPR) and Proton Electron Double Resonance Imaging ((PEDRI). Examples of the usefulness of EPR in the field of drug delivery include the measurement of microviscosity and micropolarity, the direct detection of drug release mechanisms in vitro and in vivo, the monitoring of microacidity in biodegradable polymers and the characterisation of colloidal drug carriers.

abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of molecules in a solution at room temperature has potential to revolutionize nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. The prevalent methods for achieving DNP in solutions are typically most effective in the regime of small interaction correlation times between the electron and nuclear spins, limiting the size of accessible molecules. To solve this limitation, we design a mechanism for DNP in the liquid phase that is applicable for large interaction correlation times. Importantly, while this mechanism makes use of a resonance condition similar to solid-state DNP, the polarization transfer is robust to a relatively large detuning from the resonance due to molecular motion. We combine this scheme with optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds to design a setup that employs optical pumping and is therefore not limited by room temperature electron thermal polarisation. We illustrate numerically the effectiveness of the model in a flow cell containing nanodiamonds immobilized in a hydrogel, polarising flowing water molecules 4700-fold above thermal polarisation in a magnetic field of 0.35 T, in volumes detectable by current NMR scanners.},

A spirocyclohexyl spin label has been prepared that has longer Tm between 80 and 295 K in immobilized samples than conventional labels.

Interspin distances up to ∼4 nm were measured by DEER at temperatures up to 160 K in water/glycerol glasses. In a glassy trehalose matrix the Tm for the doubly labeled T4 lysozyme was long enough to measure an interspin distance of 3.2 nm at 295 K, which could not be measured for the same protein labeled with the conventional 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-(methyl)methanethio-sulfonate label.},

  abstract  = {PELDOR (or DEER; pulsed electron-electron double resonance) is an EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) method that measures via the dipolar electron-electron coupling distances in the nanometre range, currently 1.5-8 nm, with high precision and reliability. Depending on the quality of the data, the error can be as small as 0.1 nm. Beyond mere mean distances, PELDOR yields distance distributions, which provide access to conformational distributions and dynamics. It can also be used to count the number of monomers in a complex and allows determination of the orientations of spin centres with respect to each other. If, in addition to the dipolar through-space coupling, a through-bond exchange coupling mechanism contributes to the overall coupling both mechanisms can be separated and quantified. Over the last 10 years PELDOR has emerged as a powerful new biophysical method without size restriction to the biomolecule to be studied, and has been applied to a large variety of nucleic acids as well as proteins and protein complexes in solution or within membranes. Small nitroxide spin labels, paramagnetic metal ions, amino acid radicals or intrinsic clusters and cofactor radicals have been used as spin centres.},

Here we showed that reengineering of the receptor binding surface of arrestin-1 further improves the binding to Rh* while preserving protein stability. In mammals, arrestin-1 readily self-associates at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this phenomenon can only be elucidated by replacing wild type arrestin-1 in living animals with a non-oligomerizing mutant retaining all other functions. We demonstrate that constitutively monomeric forms of arrestin-1 are sufficiently stable for in vivo expression. We also tested the idea that individual functions of arrestin-1 can be independently manipulated to generate mutants with the desired combinations of functional characteristics. Here we showed that this approach is feasible; stable forms of arrestin-1 with high Rh* binding can be generated with or without the ability to self-associate. These novel molecular tools open the possibility of testing of the biological role of arrestin-1 self-association and pave the way to elucidation of full potential of compensational approach to gene therapy of gain-of-function receptor mutations.},

  abstract   = {The physical basis for high-affinity interactions involving proteins is complex and potentially involves a range of energetic contributions. Among these are changes in protein conformational entropy, which cannot yet be reliably computed from molecular structures. We have recently used changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformational entropy of calmodulin upon association with domains from regulated proteins. The apparent change in conformational entropy was linearly related to the overall binding entropy. This view warrants a more quantitative foundation. Here we calibrate an 'entropy meter' using an experimental dynamical proxy based on NMR relaxation and show that changes in the conformational entropy of calmodulin are a significant component of the energetics of binding. Furthermore, the distribution of motion at the interface between the target domain and calmodulin is surprisingly noncomplementary. These observations promote modification of our understanding of the energetics of protein-ligand interactions.},

  abstract = {Kinetics and particle size distributions in the spontaneous micelle-vesicle transformation of oleate vesicles are studied by dynamic light scattering and absorbance measurements. Depending upon the conditions, there are 2 different kinetic processes for vesicles formation, a cooperative and a uncooperative one. In particular, the time progress of vesicle formation follows a sigmoid behavior and it is accelerated by the presence of preformed vesicles, confirming that a cooperative micelle-vesicle interaction takes place. This effect is studied by adding fresh oleate surfactant to preformed, extruded (50 and 100 nm) oleate vesicles as well as to 50 and 100 nm extruded POPC (1-palmitoyil-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) liposomes. Both in the case of oleate and POPC the rate process of vesicle formation is remarkably accelerated with respect to the control (no preformed vesicles); and the final size distribution is very close to the narrowly distribution curve of the preformed vesicles, whereas in the control expt. (no preadded vesicles) a very broad distribution is obtained. The authors called this phenomenon the matrix effect to stress that preexisting vesicles or liposomes act as a matrix on the formation of the new ones. The time evolution of the particles av. radius after addn. of fresh surfactant is followed by the dynamic light scattering cumulant anal., and thus when oleate micelles are added to oleate vesicles, a slight increase of the av. dimensions is obsd., whereas in the case of oleate added to POPC liposomes, the final radius is actually smaller than the initial radius. This confirms that under certain conditions, fission of vesicles is possible. Finally, some theor. considerations on the kinetics of the micelle-vesicle cooperative transformation are drawn.

The swelling of hydrophilic domains was measured on the nanoscale by combining in situ time-resolved and long-term static experiments, yielding kinetic curves recorded over an unprecedented time scale, from hundreds of milliseconds to several years. At low water content, typically below 5 water molecules per ionic group, a limited subdiffusive regime was observed and ascribed to nanoconfinement and local interactions between charged species and water molecules. Further ultrafast and thermally activated swelling due to massive liquid water sorption was observed and analyzed by using Fick's equation. The extracted mutual water diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with pulsed field gradient NMR self-diffusion coefficient values, evidencing a water diffusion-driven process due to concentration gradients within the Nafion membrane. Finally, after completion of the ultrafast regime, the kinetic swelling curves exhibit a remarkable long-term behavior scaling as the logarithm of time, showing that the polymer membrane can continuously accommodate additional water molecules upon hydration stress. The present nanoscale kinetics results provide insights into the vapor-versus-liquid sorption mechanisms, the nanostructure of Nafion, and the role of polymer reorganization modes, highlighting that the membrane can never reach a steady state.},

The novel reagents include 4-substituted derivatives of either the pyrroline or pyrrolidine series of nitroxides. The spectral line shapes were analyzed as a function of side chain structure and temperature using a simulation method with a single order parameter and diffusion rates about three orthogonal axes as parameters. Taken together, the results provide strong support for an anisotropic motional model of the side chain, which was previously proposed from qualitative features of the spectra and crystal structures of spin labeled T4 lysozyme. Site-specific differences in apparent order parameter are interpreted in terms of backbone dynamics modes with characteristic correlation times in the nanosecond or faster time scale. The saturated 4-substituted pyrrolidine nitroxides are shown to be a suitable template for novel ?functionalized? side chains designed to mimic salient features of the native side chains they replace.},

  abstract = {Recent achievements in liquid state DNP at high magnetic fields showing significant enhancements on aqueous solutions have initiated strong interest in possible applications of this method to biomolecular research. However, in situ DNP of biomolecules at ambient temperatures is a challenging task due to high microwave losses leading to excessive sample heating. To avoid such heating the sample volume has to be reduced strongly to keep it away from the electric component of the microwave field. A helical double resonance structure, used for the first demonstrations of the applicability of Overhauser DNP to aqueous solutions at high magnetic fields (9.2 T), restricted the sample size to a very small volume of 2 nl. Together with a poor spectral resolution this resulted in small overall signal amplitude, hampering observations of biomolecules. Here we present a new type of the double resonance structure for liquid-state DNP which consists of a Fabry-Perot resonator for the microwave excitation and a stripline resonator for the NMR detection. This new double resonance structure (260 GHz/400 MHz) offers a 30-fold increase in aqueous sample volume (80 nl) with respect to the helical probe and exhibits improved NMR sensitivity and linewidth.},

  abstract = {Efficient protein folding implies a microscopic funnel-like multidimensional free-energy landscape. Macroscopically, conformational entropy reduction can manifest itself as part of an empirical barrier in the traditional view of folding, but experiments show that such barriers can also entail significant unfavorable enthalpy changes. This observation raises the puzzling possibility, irrespective of conformational entropy, that individual microscopic folding trajectories may encounter large uphill moves and thus the multidimensional free-energy landscape may not be funnel-like. Here, we investigate how nanoscale hydrophobic interactions might underpin this salient enthalpic effect in biomolecular assembly by computer simulations of the association of two preformed polyalanine or polyleucine helices in water. We observe a high, positive enthalpic signature at room temperature when the helix separation is less than a single layer of water molecules. Remarkably, this unfavorable enthalpy change, with a parallel increase in void volume, is largely compensated for by a concomitant increase in solvent entropy, netting only a small or nonexistent microscopic free-energy barrier. Thus, our findings suggest that high enthalpic folding barriers can be consistent with a funnel picture of folding and are mainly a desolvation phenomenon indicative of a cooperative mechanism of simultaneous formation of multiple side-chain contacts at the rate-limiting step.},

abstract = {Saturation transfer ESR has been used to study the dynamic behaviour of lipids in the appressed regions of thylakoid membranes from pea seedlings. Four different phospho- and galacto-lipid spin labels (phosphatidylcholine labelled at the 12 or 14 C-atom positions of the sn-2 chain, phosphatidylglycerol labelled at the 14-position of the sn-2 chain, and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol labelled at the 12-position of the sn-2 chain) were used to probe the lipid environment in photosystem II-enriched membranes prepared by detergent extraction. The ESR spectra show that the majority of the lipid in these preparations is strongly motionally restricted. Values for the effective rotational correlation times of the labelled chains were deduced from the lineheight ratios and integrals of thhe saturation transfer ESR spectra. The effective rotational correlation times were found to be in the 105 range, indicating a very low lipid chain mobility which correlates with the low lipid content of these preparations. Comparison of the effective rotational correlation times deduced from the different diagnostic regions of the spectrum revealed little anisotropy in the chain mobility, indicating that the dominant motional mode was trans-gauche isomerization. The effective rotational correlation times deduced from the spectral integrals were similar to those deduced from the lineheight ratios, consistent with the absence of any appreciable fluid lipid component in these preparations. The results also indicate some selectivity of interaction between the lipid species, with phosphatidylcholine exhibiting appreciably slower motion than either phosphatidylglycerol or monogalactosyldiacylglycerol.},

However, the mechanism of NDS interaction with metabolic membrane proteins is poorly understood, partly due to the inherent complexity of single cell organisms. Here we use the light-activated electron transport chain of spinach thylakoid membrane as a model system to study how NDS interacts with metabolic activity. We find protein modification, as opposed to membrane pump activity, to be the dominant source of NDS signal change in this system. Potential mechanisms for such protein modifications include reactive oxygen species generation and light-activated phosphorylation.},

  abstract = {Retroviral proteases are obligate homodimers and play an essential role in the viral life cycle. Dissociation of dimers or prevention of their assembly may inactivate these enzymes and prevent viral maturation. A salient structural feature of these enzymes is an extended interface composed of interdigitating N- and C-terminal residues of both monomers, which form a four-stranded beta-sheet. Peptides mimicking one beta-strand (residues 95-99), or two beta-strands (residues 1-5 plus 95-99 or 95-99 plus 95-99) from the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) interface were shown to inhibit the HIV1 and 2 proteases (PRs) with IC50's in the low micromolar range. These interface peptides show cognate enzyme preference and do not inhibit pepsin, renin, or the Rous sarcoma virus PR, indicating a degree of specificity for the HIV PRs. A tethered HIV1 PR dimer was not inhibited to the same extent as the wild-type enzymes by any of the interface peptides, suggesting that these peptides can only interact effectively with the interface of the two-subunit HIV PR. Measurements of relative dissociation constants by limit dilution of the enzyme show that the one-strand peptide causes a shift in the observed Kd for the HIV1 PR. Both one- and two-strand peptides alter the monomer/dimer equilibrium of both HIV1 and HIV2 PRs. This was shown by the reduced cross-linking of the HIV2 PR by disuccinimidyl suberate in the presence of the interface peptides. Refolding of the HIV1 and HIV2 PRs with the interface peptides shows that only the two-strand peptides prevent the assembly of active PR dimers. Although both one- and two-strand peptides seem to affect dimer dissociation, only the two-strand peptides appear to block assembly. The latter may prove to be more effective backbones for the design of inhibitors directed toward retroviral PR dimerization in vivo.},

The intensity of artifact peaks is found to depend on the phase of the radio frequency field which in turn is defined with respect to the geometry of the spin system.

The theoretical models devised so far consist typically of sets of independent dynamic modes. Each such mode is simple and usually case-specific. In this scenario, model improvement entails adding yet another mode (thereby changing the overall model), comparison of different cases is difficult, and ambiguity is unavoidable. We recently developed the microscopic order macroscopic disorder (MOMD) approach as a single-mode alternative.

The success with fitting these four disparate cases, as well as the two cases in the previous report, demonstrates the generality of this MOMD-based approach. In this study, C?D and C?CD3 are both found to execute axial diffusion (rates R? and R?) in the presence of a rhombic potential given by the L = 2 spherical harmonics (coefficients c02 and c22). R?

  abstract = {Analytical motional models are described for the interpretation of NMR cross relaxation between protein protons and water protons, treating bulk water as a self-diffusing continuum. Using intermolecular dipolar relaxation theory, scaling arguments, and numerical calculations, the distance dependence of the cross-relaxation rate constant between the protein proton and the first hydration shell is discussed for planar and spherical surface geometries. It is found that differential effects between NOESY and ROESY rate constants depend strongly on geometrical factors and do not directly reflect residence times of individual water molecules on the protein surface. Restriction of water diffusion to a coarse lattice leads qualitatively to the same NMR relaxation behavior, but X-ray crystallography would display well-ordered water structure, illustrating the complementary views of the two techniques on protein hydration.},

  abstract  = {Allosteric propagation results in communication between distinct sites in the protein structure; it also encodes specific effects on cellular pathways, and in this way it shapes cellular response. One example of long-range effects is binding of morphogens to cell surface receptors, which initiates a cascade of protein interactions that leads to genome activation and specific cellular action. Allosteric propagation results from combinations of multiple factors, takes place through dynamic shifts of conformational ensembles, and affects the equilibria of macromolecular interactions. Here, we (a) emphasize the well-known yet still underappreciated role of allostery in conveying explicit signals across large multimolecular assemblies and distances to specify cellular action; (b) stress the need for quantitation of the allosteric effects; and finally, (c) propose that each specific combination of allosteric effectors along the pathway spells a distinct function. The challenges are colossal; the inspiring reward will be predicting function, misfunction, and outcomes of drug regimes.},

  abstract  = {Imidazole phosphate and phosphonate solid acids model the hydrogen-bonding networks and dynamics of the anhydrous electrolyte candidate for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Solid-state NMR reveals that phosphate and phosphonate anion dynamics dominate the rate of long-range proton transport, and that the presence of a membrane host facilitates proton mobility, as evidenced by a decreased correlation time of the composites (80 ± 15 ms) relative to the pristine salt (101 ± 5 ms). Benzimidazole ethylphosphonate (Bi-ePA) is chosen as a model salt to investigate the membrane system. The hydrogen-bonding structure of Bi-ePA is established using X-ray diffraction coupled with solid-state (1)H-(1)H DQC NMR. The anion dynamics has been determined using solid-state (31)P CODEX NMR. By comparing the dynamics of ethylphosphonate groups in pristine salt and membrane-salt composites, it is clear that the rotation process involves three-site exchange. Through data interpretation, a stretched exponential function is introduced with the stretching exponent, $\beta$, ranging 0 {\textless} $\beta$ ≤ 1. The (31)P CODEX data for pristine salt are fitted with single exponential decay where $\beta$ = 1; however, the data for the membrane-salt composites are fitted with stretched exponential functions, where $\beta$ has a constant value of 0.5. This $\beta$ value suggests a non-Gaussian distribution of the dynamic systems in the composite sample, which is introduced by the membrane host.},

Incorporation of 1.5, 3, or 6 mol{\%} palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine resulted in a decrease of the order parameter of 16-doxyl stearate from 0.164 to 0.161, 0.155, and 0.145, resp. Similar increases in membrane fluidity in the interior of the bilayer were present when palmitoyl lyosphosphatidylethanolamine, L-palmitoyl carnitine, and platelet-activating factor were incorporated into sarcolemma. In contrast, incubation of sarcolemma with lysophosphatidylcholine did not result in significant change of the order parameter of 5-doxyl stearate, even at 6 mol{\%}, demonstrating that lysophosphatidylcholine increases the transmembrane fluidity gradient. Sarcolemma treated with phospholipase A2 exhibited a time-dependent decrease in the rotational correlation time and order parameter when lysophospholipids constituted a small amt. (6{\%}) of sarcolemmal phospholipids. Furthermore, the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine were not dependent upon its phys. state, since bilayers composed of gramicidin and lysophosphatidylcholine resulted in similar increases in membrane fluidity as micellar lysophosphatidylcholine. The results suggest that alterations in sarcolemmal mol. dynamics are one mechanism through which amphiphilic moieties mediate their multiple effects.

abstract = {Amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymers, also known as poloxamers, have broad biomembrane activities. To illustrate the nature of these activities, (1)H Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy was employed to sensitively detect polymer-lipid membrane interactions through the modulation of local hydration dynamics in lipid membranes. Our study shows P188, the most hydrophilic poloxamer that is a known membrane sealant, weakly adsorbs on the membrane surface, yet effectively retards membrane hydration dynamics. Contrarily, P181, the most hydrophobic poloxamer that is a known membrane permeabilizer, initially embeds at lipid headgroups and enhances intrabilayer water diffusivity. Unprecedented resolution for differentiating weak surface adsorption versus translocation of polymers to membranes is obtained by probing local water diffusivity in lipid bilayer systems. Our results illustrate that the relative hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of the polymer dictates its functions. These findings gleaned from local hydration dynamics are well supported by a thermodynamics study presented in the accompanying paper (Wang, J.-Y.; Marks, J. M.; Lee, K. Y. C.

The clinical applicability of these approaches is exemplified by the efficacy of lipoglycopeptides that damage bacterial membranes and of the diarylquinoline TMC207, which inhibits membrane-bound ATP synthase.

Using alternating-laser excitation and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 as a model, we show that chemical labeling of a unique cysteine, followed by enzymatic modification of a reactive glutamine in an N-terminally appended substrate sequence recognition tag for transglutaminase (TGase) affords stoichiometrically D-/A-labeled protein suitable for single-molecule FRET experiments. Thermodynamic data indicate that neither the presence of the TGase tag nor D/A labeling perturbs protein stability. As the N terminus in proteins is typically solvent accessible, a TGase tag can (in principle) be appended to any protein of interest by genetic engineering. Two-step chemical/enzymatic labeling may thus represent a simple, low-cost, and widely available strategy for D/A labeling of proteins for FRET-based single-molecule protein folding studies, even for non-protein-experts laboratories.},

abstract = {A simple strategy to separate overlapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals in biological systems is presented. Pulsed EPR methods (inversion- and saturation-recovery) allow the determination of the T(1) spin-lattice relaxation times of paramagnetic centers. T(1) may vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the species under investigation. These variations can be employed to study selectively individual species from a spectrum that results from an overlap of two species using an inversion-recovery filtered (IRf) pulsed EPR technique. The feasibility of such an IRf field-swept technique is demonstrated on model compounds (alpha,gamma-bisphenylene-beta-phenylallyl-benzolate, BDPA, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl, TEMPO) and a simple strategy for the successful analysis of such mixtures is presented. Complex I is a multisubunit membrane protein of the respiratory chain containing several iron-sulfur (FeS) centers, which are observable with EPR spectroscopy. It is not possible to investigate the functionally important FeS cluster N2 separately because this EPR signal always overlaps with the other FeS signals. This cluster can be studied selectively using the IRf field-swept technique and its EPR spectrum is in excellent agreement with previous cw-EPR data from the literature. In addition, the possibility to separate the hyperfine spectra of two spectrally overlapping paramagnetic species is demonstrated by applying this relaxation filter together with hyperfine spectroscopy (REFINE). For the first time, the application of this filter to a three-pulse electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) pulse sequence is demonstrated to selectively observe hyperfine spectra on a system containing two paramagnetic species. Finally, REFINE is used to assign the observed nitrogen modulation in complex I to an individual iron-sulfur cluster.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in developing 2D-ELDOR (2D electron-electron double resonance) techniques to better capture molecular dynamics in complex fluids, particularly in model and biological membranes, is reported. The new "full S(c-) method", which corrects the spectral analysis for the phase distortion effects present in the experiments, is demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of 2D-ELDOR in reporting on molecular dynamics in complex membrane environments. That is, instead of performing spectral fitting in the magnitude mode, our new method enables simultaneous fitting of both the real and imaginary components of the S(c-) signal. The full S(c-) fitting not only corrects the phase distortions in the experimental data but also more accurately determines instrumental dead times. The phase corrections applied to the S(c-) spectrum enable the extraction of the pure absorption-mode spectrum, which is characterized by much better resolution than the magnitude-mode spectrum. In the absorption mode, the variation of homogeneous broadening, which reports on the dynamics of the spin probe, can even be observed by visual inspection. This new method is illustrated with results from model membranes of dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC)-cholesterol binary mixtures, as well as with results from plasma membrane vesicles of mast cells. In addition to the dynamic parameters, which provide quantitative descriptions for membranes at the molecular level, the high-resolution absorption spectra themselves may be used as a "fingerprint" to characterize membrane phases and distinguish coexisting components in biomembranes. Thus we find that 2D-ELDOR is greatly improved with the new "full S(c-) method" especially for exploring the complexity of model and biological membranes.},

  abstract  = {In recent years Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) signal enhancement techniques have become an important and integral part of modern NMR and MRI spectroscopy. The DNP mechanisms transferring polarization from unpaired electrons to the nuclei in the sample is accomplished by microwave (MW) irradiation. For solid samples a distinction is made between three main enhancement processes: Solid Effect (SE), Cross Effect (CE) and Thermal Mixing (TM) DNP. In a recent study we revisited the solid state SE-DNP mechanism at high magnetic fields, using a spin density operator description involving spin relaxation, for the case of an isolated electron spin interacting with neighboring nuclei. In this publication we extend this study by considering the hyper-polarization of nuclei in systems containing two interacting electrons. In these spin systems both processes SE-DNP and CE-DNP are simultaneously active. As previously, a quantum description taking into account spin relaxation is used to calculate the dynamics of spin systems consisting of interacting electron pairs coupled to (core) nuclei. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the dependence of the SE- and CE-DNP enhancements on the MW irradiation power and frequency, on electron, nuclear and cross relaxation mechanisms and on the spin interactions. The influence of the presence of many nuclei on the hyper-polarization of an individual core nucleus is examined, showing the similarities between the two DNP processes. These studies also indicate the advantages of the CE- over the SE-DNP processes, both driving the polarization of the bulk nuclei, via the nuclear dipole-dipole interactions.},

abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit complex, which catalyzes the photo-induced oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. Difference Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy can be used to obtain information about the structural changes accompanying oxidation of the redox-active tyrosines, D and Z, in PSII. The focus of our work is the assignment of the 1478 cm-1 vibration, which is observable in difference infrared spectra associated with these tyrosyl radicals. The first set of FT-IR experiments is performed with continuous illumination. Use of cyanobacterial strains, in which isotopomers of tyrosine have been incorporated, supports the assignment of a positive 1478/1477 cm-1 mode to the C-O stretching vibration of the tyrosyl radicals. In negative controls, the intensity of this spectral feature decreases. The negative controls involve the use of inhibitors or site-directed mutants, in which the oxidation of Z or D is eliminated, respectively. The assignment of the 1478/1477 cm-1 mode is also based on control EPR and fluorescence measurements, which demonstrate that no detectable Fe+2Q(A)- signal is generated under FT-IR experimental conditions. Additionally, the difference infrared spectrum, associated with formation of the S2Q(A)- state, argues against the assignment of the positive 1478 cm-1 line to the C-O vibration of Q(A)-. In the second set of FT-IR experiments, single turnover flashes are employed, and infrared difference spectra are recorded as a function of time after photoexcitation. Comparison to kinetic transients generated in control EPR experiments shows that the decay of the 1477 cm-1 line precisely parallels the decay of the D?? EPR signal. Taken together, these two experimental approaches strongly support the assignment of a component of the 1478/1477 cm-1 vibrational lines to the C-O stretching modes of tyrosyl radicals in PSII. Possible reasons for the apparently contradictory results of {\{}Hienerwadel et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 15,447-15,460 and Hienerwadel et al.

  abstract  = {We investigate the thermal denaturation of human serum albumin and the associated solvation using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in aqueous buffer solution. Far- and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopy reveal that the protein undergoes a native (N) to extended (E) state transition at temperature ≤55°C with a marginal change in the secondary and tertiary structure. At 70°C, the protein transforms into an unfolded (U) state with significant irreversible disruption of its structures. We measure the concentration- and temperature-dependent THz absorption coefficient ($\alpha$) of the protein solution using a p-Ge THz difference spectrometer (2.1-2.8 THz frequency range), thereby probing the collective protein-water network dynamics. When the solvated protein is heated up to 55°C and cooled down again, a reversible change in THz absorption is observed. When increasing the temperature up to 70°C, we find a dramatic irreversible change of THz absorption. The increase in THz absorption compared to bulk water is attributed to a blue shift in the spectrum of the solvated protein compared to bulk water. This is supported by measurements of THz absorption coefficients using THz time-domain spectroscopy (0.1-1.2 THz frequency range). We also use picosecond-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of the tryptophan 214 moiety of human serum albumin. All experimental observations can be explained by a change in the hydration dynamics of the solvated protein due to the additional exposure of hydrophobic residues upon unfolding.},

On average, the enzymes' overall structures equilibrate on a 50+ ns timescale. The very open CYP2B4 structure closes slowly over the course of the simulation. The volumes of the active sites fluctuate by more than 50{\%} during the MD runs; these fluctuations are mainly due to movements of the main chains, with only a handful of amino acid residues in CYP2B4, CYP2D6, CYP2A6 and CYP2C9 showing significant independent side chain movement. The volume of the active site of CYP2E1 fluctuates heavily, ranging from 220 to 1310 A(3), due to the opening and closing of gates to two adjacent cavities. CYP2E1 has the least hydrated active site of the studied CYPs; this is consistent with its preference for non-polar substrates. The CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 active sites are deeply buried, with access paths that are narrower than the radius of a water molecule. However, waters are still able to access these active sites due to local adaptations of the channel to accommodate their passage. This finding may imply that the access paths of the CYPs never fully open prior to contact with the substrate; instead, the substrate may induce adaptive conformational changes during its passage to the active site. This may also explain why some substrate recognition sites are localized along individual enzymes' access paths.},

It was found that the large soft anions such as SCN(-) and I(-) interact with the polypeptide backbone via a hybrid binding site that consists of the amide nitrogen and the adjacent $\alpha$-carbon. The hydrocarbon groups at these sites bear a slight positive charge, which enhances anion binding without disrupting specific hydrogen bonds to water molecules. The hydrophobic side chains do not contribute significantly to anion binding or the corresponding salting-in behavior of the biopolymer. Cl(-) binds far more weakly to the amide nitrogen/$\alpha$-carbon binding site, while SO(4)(2-) is repelled from both the backbone and hydrophobic side chains of the polypeptide. The Na(+) counterions are also repelled from the polypeptide. The identification of these molecular-level binding sites provides new insights into the mechanism of peptide-anion interactions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of studies exploring the relationship between proteins' equilibrium dynamics and structural changes involved in function. An emerging concept, supported by both theory and experiments, is that under native state conditions proteins have an intrinsic ability to sample conformations that meet functional requirements. A typical example is the ability of enzymes to sample open and closed forms, irrespective of substrate, succeeded by the stabilization of one form (usually closed) upon substrate binding. This ability is structure-encoded, and plays a key role in facilitating allosteric regulation, which suggests complementing the sequence-encodes-structure paradigm of protein science by structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The emerging connection implies an evolutionary role in selecting/conserving structures based on their ability to achieve functional dynamics, and in turn, selecting sequences that fold into such 'apt' structures.},

The aim of our experiments was to test the activity of 2D crystal sample preparations and to gain further insight in PR structure, stability and function with these techniques. Our results demonstrate higher stability compared to detergent-solubilized or reconstituted samples. For different pH values, low pH 2D crystals tend to form bigger aggregates and are less stable than at basic pH. The pH 9 sample shows a sharp phase transition during heat denaturation and there is also evidence for protein-protein interaction due to the close proximity of the proteins in the 2D crystals. In the FTIR measurements at cryogenic temperatures (77 K), we characterized the first step in the PR photocycle. At pH 9, the K intermediate could be observed and the samples showed no orientation effects. At pH 5, we could trap the K/L intermediate, characterized by its negative IR signal at 1741 cm(-1). In rapid-scan FTIR experiments, we could also identify the M intermediate of the photocycle at basic pH. We conclude that the PR 2D crystals exhibit a fully functional photocycle and are therefore well suited for further studies on the proton transport mechanism of PR.},

abstract = {A novel method we refer to as the tie-line field (TLF) method has been developed to globally determine the tie lines of any three-component two-phase coexistence region by fitting electron-spin resonance (ESR) spectra obtained from compositions on the coexistence curve and within the coexistence region. The TLF method is illustrated by applying it to the liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) phase coexistence region of the lipid system brain-sphingomyelin/dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (SPM/DOPC/chol), for which an estimate of a tie-line was previously obtained by an earlier method also using ESR spectra. The essential aspect of the TLF method is the unique parametrization of the coexistence region called a "ruled surface". The use of the ruled surface enables one to guarantee that tie lines do not cross, as required by the phase rule, whereas previous methods lack this important constraint. It also makes simultaneous use of the full data set in determining the TLF and leads to a more efficient experimental design than previously used. The method is first tested out on synthetic data sets, then least-squares fitting of the ESR spectra with the parametrized model results in a tie-line field consistent with other known information on this lipid system. The best-fit tie-line field consists of the set of tie lines which are not exactly parallel; they exhibit a gradual change in slope with the largest slope within the coexistence region connecting the coexistence curve compositions with the highest and lowest cholesterol concentrations. The results are compared with those from more constrained methods of representing the tie-line fields as well as with the previous tie-line determination for the SPM/DOPC/chol system. An accurate determination of the tie-line field of phase coexistence regions in lipid systems is a necessary step in determining coexisting lipid compositions to serve as models of cell plasma membranes.},

  abstract = {Melittin is a prototype of the ubiquitous antimicrobial peptides that induce pores in membranes. It is commonly used as a molecular device for membrane permeabilization. Even at concentrations in the nanomolar range, melittin can induce transient pores that allow transmembrane conduction of atomic ions but not leakage of glucose or larger molecules. At micromolar concentrations, melittin induces stable pores allowing transmembrane leakage of molecules up to tens of kilodaltons, corresponding to its antimicrobial activities. Despite extensive studies, aspects of the molecular mechanism for pore formation remain unclear. To clarify the mechanism, one must know the states of the melittin-bound membrane before and after the process. By correlating experiments using giant unilamellar vesicles with those of peptide-lipid multilayers, we found that melittin bound on the vesicle translocated and redistributed to both sides of the membrane before the formation of stable pores. Furthermore, stable pores are formed only above a critical peptide-to-lipid ratio. The initial states for transient and stable pores are different, which implies different mechanisms at low and high peptide concentrations. To determine the lipidic structure of the pore, the pores in peptide-lipid multilayers were induced to form a lattice and examined by anomalous X-ray diffraction. The electron density distribution of lipid labels shows that the pore is formed by merging of two interfaces through a hole. The molecular property of melittin is such that it adsorbs strongly to the bilayer interface. Pore formation can be viewed as the bilayer adopting a lipid configuration to accommodate its excessive interfacial area.},

Such linear systems arise in important applications, such as the numerical solution of the complex Helmholtz equation. Furthermore, most complex non-Hermitian linear systems which occur in practice are actually complex symmetric. Conjugate gradient-type iterations which are based on a variant of the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm for complex symmetric matrices are investigated. In particular, a new approach with iterates defined by a quasi-minimal residual property is proposed. The resulting algorithm presents several advantages over the standard biconjugate gradient method. Some remarks are also included on the obvious approach to general complex linear systems by solving equivalent real linear systems for the real and imaginary parts of x. Finally, numerical experiments for linear systems arising from the complex Helmholtz equation are reported.},

We found that the Azz values of 16PC (DPPTC) in the  oriented DPPC and DMPC bilayers are approximately 1 Gauss smaller  (greater) than in the corresponding dispersions. These results indicate  that the headgroup region is more polar in macroscopically oriented  bilayers than in dispersions, whereas in the chain region, the order in  polarity is reversed. This is consistent with previous results on  partial molar volumes in the liquid-crystal phase. Differences in the  morphology of the macroscopically oriented and dispersed bilayers,  which might be responsible, are discussed. Nonlinear least-squares fits  of the electron spin resonance spectra of DPPTC in DPPC show that there  is a substantial orienting potential in the headgroup region of  dispersions that is lipid phase dependent. However, in oriented  membrane samples hydrated in 100{\%} relative humidity, this orienting  potential is very weak.},

abstract = {Summary
Selecting a suitable membrane-mimicking environment is of fundamental importance for the investigation of membrane proteins. Nonconventional surfactants, such as amphipathic polymers (amphipols) and lipid bilayer nanodiscs, have been introduced as promising environments that may overcome intrinsic disadvantages of detergent micelle systems. However, structural insights into the effects of different environments on the embedded protein are limited. Here, we present a comparative study of the heptahelical membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin in detergent micelles, amphipols, and nanodiscs. Our results confirm that nonconventional environments can increase stability of functional bacteriorhodopsin, and demonstrate that well-folded heptahelical membrane proteins are, in principle, accessible by solution-NMR methods in amphipols and phospholipid nanodiscs. Our data distinguish regions of bacteriorhodopsin that mediate membrane/solvent contacts in the tested environments, whereas the protein's functional inner core remains almost unperturbed. The presented data allow comparing the investigated membrane mimetics in terms of NMR spectral quality and thermal stability required for structural studies.},

  abstract      = {Many amino acid residue hydrophobicity scales have been created in an effort to better understand and rapidly characterize water–protein interactions based only on protein structure and sequence. There is surprisingly low consistency in the ranking of residue hydrophobicity between scales, and their ability to provide insightful characterization varies substantially across subject proteins. All current scales characterize hydrophobicity based on entire amino acid residue units. We introduce a simple binary but atomic-level hydrophobicity scale that allows for the classification of polar and non-polar moieties within single residues, including backbone atoms. This simple scale is first shown to capture the anticipated hydrophobic character for those whole residues that align in classification among most scales. Examination of a set of protein binding interfaces establishes good agreement between residue-based and atomic-level descriptions of hydrophobicity for five residues, while the remaining residues produce discrepancies. We then show that the atomistic scale properly classifies the hydrophobicity of functionally important regions where residue-based scales fail. To illustrate the utility of the new approach, we show that the atomic-level scale rationalizes the hydration of two hydrophobic pockets and the presence of a void in a third pocket within a single protein and that it appropriately classifies all of the functionally important hydrophilic sites within two otherwise hydrophobic pores. We suggest that an atomic level of detail is, in general, necessary for the reliable depiction of hydrophobicity for all protein surfaces. The present formulation can be implemented simply in a manner no more complex than current residue-based approaches.},

  abstract  = {Most of the decisive molecular events in biology take place at the protein-water interface. The dynamical properties of the hydration layer are therefore of fundamental importance. To characterize the dynamical heterogeneity and rotational activation energy in the hydration layer, we measured the (17)O spin relaxation rate in dilute solutions of three proteins in a wide temperature range extending down to 238 K. We find that the rotational correlation time can be described by a power-law distribution with exponent 2.1-2.3. Except for a small fraction of secluded hydration sites, the dynamic perturbation in the hydration layer is the same for all proteins and does not differ in any essential way from the hydration shell of small organic solutes. In both cases, the dynamic perturbation factor is {\textless}2 at room temperature and exhibits a maximum near 262 K. This maximum implies that, at low temperatures, the rate of water molecule rotation has a weaker temperature dependence in the hydration layer than in bulk water. We attribute this difference to the temperature-independent constraints that the protein surface imposes on the water H-bond network. The free hydration layer studied here differs qualitatively from confined water in solid protein powder samples.},

abstract = {The transport diffusivity of the paramagnetic molecule 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) was measured by monitoring its influence on the NMR transverse relaxation time (T₂) on surrounding water protons - also known as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). Due to the nature of the PRE effect, few paramagnetic molecules are able to simultaneously reduce the T₂ of many NMR active nuclei, which represents a significant gain in sensitivity. In an aqueous solution, the minimal detectable TEMPO concentration was around 70 ppm. The value of the diffusivity was estimated by fitting the relaxation data, collected as a function of time, with the appropriate solutions of the second Fick's law in respect to the corresponding sample geometry and dimensions. Considering the experimentally determined TEMPO relaxivity in water ("TEMPO-water relaxivity"; R(TEMPO) = (1.05 ± 0.12) × 10⁻³ ppm⁻¹ s⁻¹), the obtained diffusion coefficients (D) of TEMPO in homogeneous solution and in a water saturated sand column (D(bulk) = (6.7 ± 0.4) × 10⁻¹⁰ m² s⁻¹ and D(sand) = (1.4 ± 0.5) × 10⁻¹⁰ m² s⁻¹, respectively) are in good agreement with the expected values (literature values: D(bulk) = 6.6 × 10⁻¹⁰ m² s⁻¹, 1.3 × 10⁻¹⁰ m² s⁻¹ {\textless} D(sand) {\textless} 2.3 × 10⁻¹⁰ m² s⁻¹). This new approach enables one to determine the diffusivity of paramagnetic molecules in homogeneous (aqueous solution) and porous media with basic NMR equipment, at low concentrations and in a noninvasive manner.},

  abstract  = {Water molecules at the surface of DNA are critical to its equilibrium structure, DNA-protein function, and DNA-ligand recognition. Here we report direct probing of the dynamics of hydration, with femtosecond resolution, at the surface of a DNA dodecamer duplex whose native structure remains unperturbed on recognition in minor groove binding with the bisbenzimide drug (Hoechst 33258). By following the temporal evolution of fluorescence, we observed two well separated hydration times, 1.4 and 19 ps, whereas in bulk water the same drug is hydrated with time constants of 0.2 and 1.2 ps. For comparison, we also studied calf thymus DNA for which the hydration exhibits similar time scales to that of dodecamer DNA. However, the time-resolved polarization anisotropy is very different for the two types of DNA and clearly elucidates the rigidity in drug binding and difference in DNA rotational motions. These results demonstrate that hydration at the surface of the groove is a dynamical process with two general types of trajectories; the slowest of them (approximately 20 ps) are those describing dynamically ordered water. Because of their ultrafast time scale, the "ordered" water molecules are the most weakly bound and are accordingly involved in the entropic (hydration/dehydration) process of recognition.},

Here, we investigate using molecular dynamics simulations dynamical properties of the water confined in hydrophilic protein–protein and protein–DNA interfaces. We find that the interfacial water exhibits glassy slow relaxations even at 300 K. In particular, the rotational dynamics show a logarithmic decay that was observed in glass-forming liquids at deeply supercooled states. We argue that such slow water dynamics are indeed induced by the hydrophilic binding surfaces, which is in opposition to the picture that the hydration water slaves protein motions. Our results will significantly impact the view on the role of water in biomolecular interactions.},

However in shales, substantial hydrogen content is associated with solid and fluid signals and both may be detected. Depending on the motional regime, the signal from the solids may be best described using either exponential or Gaussian decay functions. When the inverse Laplace transform, the standard method for analysis of NMR relaxometry results, is applied to data containing Gaussian decays, this can lead to physically unrealistic responses such as signal or porosity overcall and relaxation times that are too short to be determined using the applied instrument settings. We apply a new simultaneous Gaussian-Exponential (SGE) inversion method to simulated data and measured results obtained on a variety of oil shale samples. The SGE inversion produces more physically realistic results than the inverse Laplace transform and displays more consistent relaxation behavior at high magnetic field strengths. Residuals for the SGE inversion are consistently lower than for the inverse Laplace method and signal overcall at short T2 times is mitigated. Beyond geological samples, the method can also be applied in other fields where the sample relaxation consists of both Gaussian and exponential decays, for example in material, medical and food sciences.},

abstract = {Protein dynamics in hydrated and vacuum-dried photosystem II (PS II) membrane fragments from spinach has been investigated by quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) in the temperature range between 5 and 300 K. Three distinct temperature ranges can be clearly distinguished by active type(s) of protein dynamics: (A) At low temperatures (T {\textless} 120 K), the protein dynamics of both dry and hydrated PS II is characterized by harmonic vibrational motions. (B) In the intermediate temperature range (120 {\textless} T {\textless} 240 K), the total mean square displacement {\textless}u2{\textgreater}total slightly deviates from the predicted linear behavior. The QENS data indicate that this deviation, which is virtually independent of the extent of hydration, is due to a partial onset of diffusive protein motions. (C) At temperatures above 240 K, the protein flexibility drastically changes because of the onset of diffusive (large-amplitude) protein motions. This dynamical transition is clearly hydration-dependent since it is strongly suppressed in dry PS II. The thermally activated onset of protein flexibility as monitored by QENS is found to be strictly correlated with the temperature-dependent increase of the electron transport efficiency from Q(A)(-) to QB (Garbers et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 11399-11404). Analogously, the freezing of protein mobility by dehydration in dry PS II appears to be responsible for the blockage of Q(A)(-) reoxidation by Q(B) at hydration values lower than 45{\%} r.h. (Kaminskaya et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 8119-8132). Similar effects were observed for reactions of the water-oxidizing complex as outlined in the Discussion section.},

  abstract  = {Water possesses an extremely high polarity, making it a unique solvent for salts. Indeed, aqueous electrolyte solutions are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, biology, energy applications and industrial processes. For many processes, chemical reactions at the water surface are rate determining, and the nature and concentration of the surface-bound electrolytes are of paramount importance, as they determine the water structure and thereby surface reactivity. Here we investigate the dynamics of water molecules at the surface of sodium chloride and sodium iodide solutions, using surface-specific femtosecond vibrational spectroscopy. We quantify the interfacial ion density through the reduced energy transfer rates between water molecules resulting from the lowered effective interfacial density of water molecules, as water is displaced by surface active ions. Our results reveal remarkably high surface propensities for halogenic anions, higher for iodide than for chloride ions, corresponding to surface ion concentrations several times that of the bulk.},

abstract = {The intensities of saturation-transfer EPR (ST-EPR) spectra from nitroxyl spin labels have proved a sensitive means for studying slow exchange processes (both Heisenberg spin exchange and physical/chemical exchange) and weak interactions with paramagnetic ions, via the dependence on the effective spin-lattice relaxation rate (D. Marsh,Appl. Magn. Reson.3, 53, 1992). The dependences of the second-harmonic EPR absorption intensities detected in phase quadrature with the field modulation (V'2) on the microwaveH1field, and on the effective relaxation times, were studied both theoretically and experimentally. Power-saturation curves and normalized integrated intensities (IST) of theV'2spectra were determined as a function of the concentration of a spin-labeled phospholipid in lipid membranes and of the concentration of paramagnetic Ni2+ions in the aqueous phase as a means of varying the effective relaxation times. The results were correlated with progressive-saturation measurements of the double-integrated intensities of the conventional EPR spectra. Intensities of theV'2spectra were calculated from the Bloch equations incorporating the modulation and microwave fields (K. Halbach,Helv. Phys. Acta27, 259, 1954), and the results were fitted to the experimental data. The ST-EPR intensities depend approximately linearly on the effectiveT1, but with a nonzero intercept. On the basis of the theoretical calculations and experimental correlations, relations betweenISTandT1are suggested that may improve precision in the application of this alternative form of ST-EPR spectroscopy to biological systems.},

To obtain information about the hyperfine interaction (hfi) of 33S with Mo(V), continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments have been performed.

The isotropic hfi constant of 33S determined in these experiments was about 3 MHz, which demonstrates the presence of coordinated sulfate in the sulfite-reduced low-pH form of the plant enzyme.},

From comparisons of the spectral line shapes and distance distribution profiles of spin-labeled HIV-1 protease with and without inhibitor, it was concluded that solutes such as glycerol and PEG3000 alter the line shapes of the spin label in the beta-hairpin flaps of HIV-1 PR by modulation of spin-label mobility through changes in preferential interactions with the solutes. It is noteworthy that the high osmolality of the 40{\%} glycerol solution did not alter the conformation of the flaps as determined from pulsed EPR distance measurements.},

Lineshape analysis of the singly labelled peptide reveals evidence of substantial anisotropic rotational diffusion. Combined circular dichroism and electron spin resonance of the double labelled sequences demonstrates that both the 16-residue and 20-residue peptides are completely folded and adopt predominantly the a-helical conformation. However, lineshape fitting of the 16-residue sequences cooled in MeOH revealed a surprising result. Instead of the typical $\alpha$-helix geometry of 3.6 residues per turn found in peptide and protein crystal structures, these doubly TOAC labelled peptides adopt a more open geometry of approximately 3.8-3.9 residues per turn.

B 2006, 110, jp0629487), a study of the conformational dynamics of methanethiosulfonate spin probes linked at a surface-exposed alpha-helix has been presented. Here, on the basis of this analysis, X-band ESR spectra of these spin labels are simulated within the framework of the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) methodology. Slow reorientations of the whole protein are superimposed on fast chain motions, which have been identified with conformational jumps and fluctuations in the minima of the chain torsional potential. Fast chain motions are introduced in the SLE for the protein reorientations through partially averaged magnetic tensors and relaxation times calculated according to the motional narrowing theory. The 72R1 and 72R2 mutants of T4 lysozyme, which bear the spin label at a solvent-exposed helix site, have been taken as test systems. For the side chain of the R2 spin label, only a few noninterconverting conformers are possible, whose mobility is limited to torsional fluctuations, yielding almost identical spectra, typical of slightly mobile nitroxides. In the case of R1, more complex spectra result from the simultaneous presence of constrained and mobile chain conformers, with relative weights that can depend on the local environment. The model provides an explanation for the experimentally observed dependence of the spectral line shapes on temperature, solvent, and pattern of substituents in the pyrroline ring. The relatively simple methodology presented here allows the introduction of realistic features of the spin probe dynamics into the simulation of ESR spectra of spin-labeled proteins; moreover, it provides suggestions for a proper account of such dynamics in more sophisticated approaches.},

The DNP effects at such low concentrations are weak and the experimentally achievable dynamic nuclear polarizations can be below the equilibrium polarization. This sensitivity problem is solved with an optimized home-built DNP probe head consisting of a dielectric microwave resonator and a saddle coil as close as possible to the sample. The performance of the probe head is demonstrated with both a modified pulsed EPR spectrometer and a dedicated CW EPR spectrometer equipped with a commercial NMR console. In comparison to a commercial pulsed ENDOR resonator, the home-built resonator has an FID detection sensitivity improvement of 2.15 and an electron spin excitation field improvement of 1.2. The reproducibility of the DNP results is tested on the water soluble maltose binding protein MalE of the ABC maltose importer, where we determine a net standard deviation of 9{\%} in the primary DNP data in the concentration range between 10 and 100 $\mu$M. DNP parameters are measured in a spin-labeled membrane protein, namely the vitamin B(12) importer BtuCD in both detergent-solubilized and reconstituted states. The data obtained in different nucleotide states in the presence and absence of binding protein BtuF reveal the applicability of this technique to qualitatively extract water accessibility changes between different conformations by the ratio of primary DNP parameters ϵ. The ϵ-ratio unveils the physiologically relevant transmembrane communication in the transporter in terms of changes in water accessibility at the cytoplasmic gate of the protein induced by both BtuF binding at the periplasmic region of the transporter and ATP binding at the cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains.},

Vertically aligned silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays prepared by the stain etching technique were investigated in this study. Chemical modification with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) led to the formation of superhydrophobic SiNW surface with a contact angle around 160°. A micropatterned superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic SiNW surface was fabricated using standard optical lithography techniques. Here we report on Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO) cell culture on patterned superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic silicon nanowire surfaces. It was found that the cells adhered selectively to the superhydrophilic regions while cell adhesion was almost completely suppressed on the superhydrophobic surface. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the cell cytoplasmic projections penetrate the hydrophilic silicon nanowires layer and coat the nanowires, leading to an intimate surface contact and thus a strong adhesion. On the superhydrophobic surface, the cell cytoplasmic projections remained on the top of wires. The nonfouling of the superhydrophobic SiNW substrate was attributed to a stable Cassie–Baxter state, limiting the contact with the culture medium. Another interesting finding from this study is the corrosion of the superhydrophilic SiNW surface in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution.},

abstract = {Protein dynamics is intimately related to biological function. Core dynamics is usually studied with 2H spin relaxation of the 13CDH2 group, analyzed traditionally with the model-free (MF) approach. We showed recently that MF is oversimplified in several respects. This includes the assumption that the local motion of the dynamic probe and the global motion of the protein are decoupled, the local geometry is simple, and the local ordering is axially symmetric. Because of these simplifications MF has yielded a puzzling picture where the methyl rotation axis is moving rapidly with amplitudes ranging from nearly complete disorder to nearly complete order in tightly packed protein cores. Our conclusions emerged from applying to methyl dynamics in proteins the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) approach of Polimeno and Freed (Polimeno, A.; Freed, J. H. J. Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 10995-11006.), which can be considered the generalization of MF, with all the simplifications mentioned above removed. The SRLS picture derived here for the B1 immunoglobulin binding domain of peptostreptococcal protein L, studied over the temperature range of 15-45 degrees C, is fundamentally different from the MF picture. Thus, methyl dynamics is characterized structurally by rhombic local potentials with varying symmetries and dynamically by tenfold slower rates of local motion. On average, potential rhombicity decreases, mode-coupling increases, and the rate of local motion increases with increasing temperature. The average activation energy for local motion is 2.0 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol. Mode-coupling affects the analysis even at 15 degrees C. The accuracy of the results is improved by including in the experimental data set relaxation rates associated with rank 2 coherences.},

abstract = {Chirality plays a fundamental part in the activity of biological molecules and broad classes of chemical reactions, but detecting and quantifying it remains challenging. The spectroscopic methods of choice are usually circular dichroism and vibrational circular dichroism, methods that are forbidden in the electric dipole approximation. The resultant weak effects produce weak signals, and thus require high sample densities. In contrast, nonlinear techniques probing electric-dipole-allowed effects have been used for sensitive chiral analyses of liquid samples. Here we extend this class of approaches by carrying out nonlinear resonant phase-sensitive microwave spectroscopy of gas phase samples in the presence of an adiabatically switched non-resonant orthogonal electric field; we use this technique to map the enantiomer-dependent sign of an electric dipole Rabi frequency onto the phase of emitted microwave radiation. We outline theoretically how this results in a sensitive and species-selective method for determining the chirality of cold gas-phase molecules, and implement it experimentally to distinguish between the S and R enantiomers of 1,2-propanediol and their racemic mixture. This technique produces a large and definitive signature of chirality, and has the potential to determine the chirality of multiple species in a mixture.},

abstract = {With the aim to obtain new materials with special properties to be used in various industrial and biomedical applications, ternary ``gold$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}clay$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}epoxy'' nanocomposites and their nanodispersions were prepared using clay decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), at different gold contents. Nanocomposites structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Rheology and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques were used in order to evaluate the molecular dynamics in the nanodispersions, as well as dynamics at interfaces in the nanocomposites. The percolation threshold (i.e., the filler content related to the formation of long-range connectivity of particles in the dispersed media) of the gold nanoparticles was determined to be {\$}\phi{\$}p = 0.6 wt {\%} at a fixed clay content of 3 wt {\%}. The flow activation energy and the relaxation time spectrum illustrated the presence of interfacial interactions in the ternary nanodispersions around and above the percolation threshold of AuNPs; these interfacial interactions suppressed the global molecular dynamics. It was found that below {\$}\phi{\$}p the free epoxy polymer chains ratio dominated over the chains attracted on the gold surfaces; thus, the rheological behavior was not significantly changed by the presence of AuNPs. While, around and above {\$}\phi{\$}p, the amount of the bonded epoxy polymer chains on the gold surface was much higher than that of the free chains; thus, a substantial increase in the flow activation energy and shift in the spectra to higher relaxation times appeared. The EPR signals of the nanocomposites depended on the gold nanoparticle contents and the preparation procedure thus providing a fingerprint of the different nanostructures. The EPR results from spin probes indicated that the main effect of the gold nanoparticles above {\$}\phi{\$}p, was to form a more homogeneous, viscous and polar clay$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}epoxy mixture at the nanoparticle surface. The knowledge obtained from this study is applicable to understand the role of interfaces in ternary nanocomposites with different combinations of nanofillers},

  abstract = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) studies have been performed on spin-labeled model membranes aligned using the isopotential spin-dry ultracentrifugation (ISDU) method of Clark and Rothschild. This method relies on sedimentation of the membrane fragments onto a gravitational isopotential surface with simultaneous evaporation of the solvent in a vacuum ultracentrifuge to promote alignment. The degree of alignment obtainable using ISDU, as monitored by ESR measurements of molecular ordering for both lipid (16-PC) and cholestane spin labels (CSL), in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) model membranes compares favorably with that obtainable by pressure-annealing. The much gentler conditions under which membranes may be aligned by ISDU greatly extends the range of macroscopically aligned membrane samples that may be investigated by ESR. We report the first ESR study of an integral membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin (BR) in well-aligned multilayers. We have also examined ISDU-aligned DPPC multilayers incorporating a short peptide gramicidin A' (GA), with higher water content than previously studied. 0.24 mol{\%} BR/DPPC membranes with CSL probe show two distinct components, primarily in the gel phase, which can be attributed to bulk and boundary regions of the bilayer. The boundary regions show sharply decreased molecular ordering and spectral effects comparable to those observed from 2 mol{\%} GA/DPPC membranes. The boundary regions for both BR and GA also exhibit increased fluidity as monitored by the rotational diffusion rates. The high water content of the GA/DPPC membranes reduces the disordering effect as evidenced by the reduced populations of the disordered components. The ESR spectra obtained slightly below the main phase transition of DPPC from both the peptide- and protein-containing membranes reveals a new component with increased ordering of the lipids associated with the peptide or protein. This increase coincides with a broad endothermic peak in the DSC, suggesting a disaggregation of both the peptide and the protein before the main phase transition of the lipid. Detailed simulations of the multicomponent ESR spectra have been performed by the latest nonlinear least-squares methods, which have helped to clarify the spectral interpretations. It is found that the simulations of ESR spectra from CSL in the gel phase for all the lipid membranes studied could be significantly improved by utilizing a model with CSL molecules existing as both hydrogen-bonded to the bilayer interface and non-hydrogen-bonded within the bilayer.},

A more detailed description is presented of the implementation of PDS to reconstruct the ternary structure of a large dimeric protein complex from Thermotoga maritima, formed by the histidine kinase CheA and the coupling protein CheW. This protein complex is a building block of an extensive array composed of coupled supramolecular structures assembled from CheA/CheW proteins and transmembrane signaling chemoreceptors, which make up a sensor that is key to controlling the motility in bacterial chemotaxis. The reconstruction of the CheA/CheW complex has employed several techniques, including X-ray crystallography and pulsed ESR. Emphasis is on the role of PDS, which is part of a larger effort to reconstruct the entire signaling complex, including chemoreceptor, by means of PDS structural mapping. In order to precisely establish the mode of coupling of CheW to CheA and to globally map the complex, approximately 70 distances have already been determined and processed into molecular coordinates by readily available methods of distance geometry constraints.},

abstract = {Genome packaging into preformed viral procapsids is driven by powerful molecular motors. The small terminase protein is essential for the initial recognition of viral DNA and regulates the motor's ATPase and nuclease activities during DNA translocation. The crystal structure of a full-length small terminase protein from the Siphoviridae bacteriophage SF6, comprising the N-terminal DNA binding, the oligomerization core, and the C-terminal $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}-barrel domains, reveals a nine-subunit circular assembly in which the DNA-binding domains are arranged around the oligomerization core in a highly flexible manner. Mass spectrometry analysis and four further crystal structures show that, although the full-length protein exclusively forms nine-subunit assemblies, protein constructs missing the C-terminal $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}-barrel form both nine-subunit and ten-subunit assemblies, indicating the importance of the C terminus for defining the oligomeric state. The mechanism by which a ring-shaped small terminase oligomer binds viral DNA has not previously been elucidated. Here, we probed binding in vitro by using EPR and surface plasmon resonance experiments, which indicated that interaction with DNA is mediated exclusively by the DNA-binding domains and suggested a nucleosome-like model in which DNA binds around the outside of the protein oligomer.},

Traditionally, the characterization of liquid surfaces has been limited to macroscopic experimental techniques such as surface tension and electrostatic potential measurements, wherein the microscopic picture then has to be inferred by applying theoretical models. Because the surface tension of electrolyte solutions generally increases with ion concentration, all inorganic ions have been thought to be repelled from the air-water interface, leaving the outermost surface layer essentially devoid of ions. This oversimplified picture has recently been challenged: first by chemical kinetics measurements, then by theoretical molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable models, and most recently by new surface sensitive experimental observations. Here we present an overview of the nature of the interfacial structure of electrolyte solutions and give a detailed description of the new picture that is emerging.},

Image analysis reveals an inhomogeneous conductivity distribution which is attributed to the limited connectivity of hydrophilic domains. This information relates to the micro-morphology which is due to phase separation of the hydrophobic polymer backbone and the hydrophilic pendant groups. The direct images relate to a different length scale and are complementary to the x-ray diffraction investigations which provide only average information. Furthermore, the measured current values reveal an interesting correlation with the size of the conductive areas. A bimodal conductivity distribution suggests that there are different mechanisms which contribute to the proton current in Nafion. Additionally, time dependence in local conductivity is found and interpreted in terms of redistribution of water in the membrane. A statistical analysis of the current distribution is performed and compared with theoretical simulations. Evidence is found for the existence of a critical current density. On a timescale of seconds the response of the conductive network is probed by applying voltage steps to the atomic force microscope tip.},

Two semisynthetic CPT derivatives bearing the paramagnetic moiety were synthesized, and their biological activity was tested. A 22-mer DNA oligonucleotide sequence with high affinity cleavage site for Top1 was also synthesized. EPR experiments were carried out on modified CPT in the presence of DNA, of Top1, or of both. In the last case, a slow motion component in the EPR signal appeared, indicating the formation of the ternary complex. Deconvolution of the EPR spectrum allowed to obtain the relative drug amounts in the complex. It was also possible to demonstrate that the residence time of CPT ``trapped'' in the ternary complex is longer than hundreds of microseconds.},

The in vivo T, relaxation time of C-13 in the urea solution was determined to 20 +/- 2 s. Due to the long relaxation time, it is possible to use the hyperpolarized substance for medical imaging. A series of high-resolution (approximate to1-mm) magnetic resonance images were acquired, each with a scan time of 240 ms, 0-5 s after an i.v. injection of the hyperpolarized aqueous [C-13]urea solution in a rat. The results show that it is possible to perform C-13 angiography with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximate to275 in approximate to0.25 s.

  abstract = {To date, the cross effect (CE) and thermal mixing (TM) mechanisms have consistently provided the largest enhancements in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments performed at high magnetic fields. Both involve a three-spin electron-electron-nucleus process whose efficiency depends primarily on two electron-electron interactions--the interelectron distance R and the correct electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) frequency separation that matches the nuclear Larmor frequency, /omega(e2)-omega(e1)/ = omega(n). Biradicals, for example, two 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyls (TEMPOs) tethered with a molecular linker, can in principle constrain both the distance and relative g-tensor orientation between two unpaired electrons, allowing these two spectral parameters to be optimized for the CE and TM. To verify this hypothesis, we synthesized a series of biradicals--bis-TEMPO tethered by n ethylene glycol units (a.k.a. BTnE)--that show an increasing DNP enhancement with a decreasing tether length. Specifically at 90 K and 5 T, the enhancement grew from approximately 40 observed with 10 mM monomeric TEMPO, where the average R approximately 56 A corresponding to electron-electron dipolar coupling constant omega(d)2 pi = 0.3 MHz, to approximately 175 with 5 mM BT2E (10 mM electrons) which has R approximately 13 A with omega(d)2 pi = 24 MHz. In addition, we compared these DNP enhancements with those from three biradicals having shorter and more rigid tethers-bis-TEMPO tethered by oxalyl amide, bis-TEMPO tethered by the urea structure, and 1-(TEMPO-4-oxyl)-3-(TEMPO-4-amino)-propan-2-ol (TOTAPOL) TOTAPOL is of particular interest since it is soluble in aqueous media and compatible with DNP experiments on biological systems such as membrane and amyloid proteins. The interelectron distances and relative g-tensor orientations of all of these biradicals were characterized with an analysis of their 9 and 140 GHz continuous-wave EPR lineshapes. The results show that the largest DNP enhancements are observed with BT2E and TOTAPOL that have shorter tethers and the two TEMPO moieties are oriented so as to satisfy the matching condition for the CE.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations in the small GTPase K-Ras are the most common activating lesions found in human cancer, and are generally associated with poor response to standard therapies. Efforts to target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in functional activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by GTPase activity, the nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an advantage over GDP and increases the proportion of active GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C). These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic studies reveal the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector binding switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C) disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing binding to Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a new allosteric regulatory site on Ras that is targetable in a mutant-specific manner.},

Such a spectrometer can be relatively easily built from a single DAC (digital to analog converter) board with a modest number of stock components and offers powerful capabilities for automated digital calibration and correction routines that allow it to generate shaped X-band pulses with precise amplitude and phase control. It can precisely tailor the excitation profiles "seen" by the spins in the microwave resonator, based on feedback calibration with experimental input. We demonstrate the capability to generate a variety of pulse shapes, including rectangular, triangular, Gaussian, sinc, and adiabatic rapid passage waveforms. We then show how one can precisely compensate for the distortion and broadening caused by transmission into the microwave cavity in order to optimize corrected waveforms that are distinctly different from the initial, uncorrected waveforms. Specifically, we exploit a narrow EPR signal whose width is finer than the features of any distortions in order to map out the response to a short pulse, which, in turn, yields the precise transfer function of the spectrometer system. This transfer function is found to be consistent for all pulse shapes in the linear response regime. In addition to allowing precise waveform shaping capabilities, the spectrometer presented here offers complete digital control and calibration of the spectrometer that allows one to phase cycle the pulse phase with 0.007° resolution and to specify the inter-pulse delays and pulse durations to ≤ 250 ps resolution. The implications and potential applications of these capabilities will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Methods to determine distances between paramagnetic metal centers and radicals are scarce. This is unfortunate because paramagnetic metal centers are frequent in biological systems and so far have not been employed much as distance markers. Successful pulse sequences that directly target the dipolar interactions cannot be applied to paramagnetic metal centers with fast relaxation rates and large g-anisotropy, if no echos can be detected and the excitation bandwidth is not sufficient to cover a sufficiently large part of the spectrum. The RIDME method Kulik et al. (2002) [20] circumvents this problem by making use of the T(1)-induced spin-flip of the transition-metal ion. Designed to measure distance between such a fast relaxing metal center and a radical, it suffers from a dead time problem. We show that this is severe because the anisotropy of the metal center broadens the dipolar curves, which therefore, only can be analyzed if the full curve is known. Here, we introduce five-pulse RIDME (5p-RIDME) that is intrinsically dead-time free. Proper functioning of the sequence is demonstrated on a nitroxide biradical. The distance between a low-spin Fe(III) center and a spin label in spin-labeled cytochrome f shows the complete dipolar trace of a transition-metal ion center and a spin label, yielding the distance expected from the structure.},

Hyperfine couplings of coordinating (17)O (I = 5/2) nuclei were detected using W-band (94 GHz) electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) detected NMR and Davies/Mims electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques. Universal (15)N (I = ½) labeling was employed to clearly discriminate the (17)O hyperfine couplings that overlap with (14)N (I = 1) signals from the D1-His332 ligand of the OEC (Stich Biochemistry 2011, 50 (34), 7390-7404). Three classes of (17)O nuclei were identified: (i) one $\mu$-oxo bridge; (ii) a terminal Mn-OH/OH(2) ligand; and (iii) Mn/Ca-H(2)O ligand(s). These assignments are based on (17)O model complex data, on comparison to the recent 1.9 {\AA} resolution PSII crystal structure (Umena Nature 2011, 473, 55-60), on NH(3) perturbation of the (17)O signal envelope and density functional theory calculations. The relative orientation of the putative (17)O $\mu$-oxo bridge hyperfine tensor to the (14)N((15)N) hyperfine tensor of the D1-His332 ligand suggests that the exchangeable $\mu$-oxo bridge links the outer Mn to the Mn(3)O(3)Ca open-cuboidal unit (O4 and O5 in the Umena et al. structure). Comparison to literature data favors the Ca-linked O5 oxygen over the alternative assignment to O4. All (17)O signals were seen even after very short (≤15 s) incubations in H(2)(17)O suggesting that all exchange sites identified could represent bound substrate in the S(1) state including the $\mu$-oxo bridge. (1)H/(2)H (I = ½, 1) ENDOR data performed at Q- (34 GHz) and W-bands complement the above findings. The relatively small (1)H/(2)H couplings observed require that all the $\mu$-oxo bridges of the Mn(4)O(5)Ca cluster are deprotonated in the S(2) state. Together, these results further limit the possible substrate water-binding sites and modes within the OEC. This information restricts the number of possible reaction pathways for O-O bond formation, supporting an oxo/oxyl coupling mechanism in S(4).},

  abstract  = {The topology of the bacterial outer-membrane enzyme, PagP, in dodecylphosphocholine micelles was studied by solution NMR using oxygen and water contacts as probes of hydrophobicity and topology. The effects of oxygen on amide protons were measured at an oxygen partial pressure of 20 atm through the paramagnetic contribution to the relaxation rates associated with the decay of two-spin order. A significant gradation of paramagnetic rates was observed for backbone amides belonging to the transmembrane residues. These rates were observed to depend on immersion depth, local hydrophobicity, and steric effects. Variations in the paramagnetic relaxation rates due to local hydrophobicity or steric effects could be, to some extent, averaged out by considering an azimuthally averaged quantity. This averaged paramagnetic rate was found to have a distinct maximum exactly in the middle of the transmembrane domain of PagP, assuming the immersion depth axis is tilted by 25 degrees with respect to the barrel axis. Contact between the protein surface and water was assessed by measuring the amide decay rates during water saturation. The comparison of local contrast effects from both water and oxygen allows one to distinguish among steric effects, local hydrophobicity, and immersion depth. For example, the absence of contrast effects from either water or oxygen at the periplasmic end of beta-strands B and C was consistent with protection effects arising from the association with the N-terminal alpha-helix. A parameter defined by the natural logarithm of the ratio of the normalized paramagnetic relaxation rate to the normalized amide decay rate under water saturation was found to correlate with immersion depth of the corresponding backbone amide nuclei. The results suggest that the oxygen/water contrast experiments give direct information regarding membrane protein topology and surface hydrophobicities, thereby complementing existing NMR structure studies and ESR spin-labeling studies.},

As the experimental conditions regarding ionic strength, temperature and the presence of detergents may affect the structure of the E-F loop, we employ electron paramagnetic resonance and site-directed spin-labeling to study the structure of this loop under physiological conditions. The amino acid residues at positions 154 to 171 were replaced by cysteine residues and derivatized with a sulfhydryl-specific nitroxide spin label one by one. The conventional and power saturation electron paramagnetic spectroscopy provide the mobility of the nitroxide and its accessibility to dissolved molecular oxygen and membrane-impermeable chromium oxalate in the respective site. The results show that K159 and A168 are located at the water-lipid interface of helices E and F, respectively. The orientation of the amino acid side-chains in the helical regions from positions 154 to 159 and 166 to 171 were found to agree with published structural data for bacteriorhodopsin. In the residue sequence from positions 160 to 165 the EPR data yield evidence for a turned loop structure with the side-chains of M163 and S162 oriented towards the proton channel and the water phase, respectively.},

abstract = {Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 ± 0.4 $\mu$L/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98{\%}) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.},

(a) The development of two-dimensional Fourier transform (FT) ESR required spectrometers providing intense pi/2 microwave pulses of very short (3-5 ns) duration, wide bandwidths, and very short dead times. It has enabled studies that resolve sophisticated details of molecular dynamics in complex fluids. (b) Methods that produce multiple quantum coherences by pulsed ESR now enable accurate measurements of large distances ({\textgreater}12A). (c) One of the most important advances has been the extension of ESR to high magnetic fields and high frequencies. This has benefited from the utilization of quasi-optical methods, especially above 150 GHz. The greatly improved orientational resolution and the faster "snapshot" of motions that are provided by ESR at high frequencies enhance studies of molecular dynamics. The use of both high and lower frequencies enables one to unravel faster and slower modes from the complex dynamics of fluids and macromolecules. (d) The development of FT-ESR imaging required substantial pulsed field gradients lasting only 50-100 ns. ESR imaging is effective in studying diffusion in fluids. Areas for further development are also described.},

The modified structure makes provision for the controlled light access to the sample placed in a flat cell during an EPR experiment. The sensitivity of the resonator for aqueous samples as well as an experimentally tested microwave magnetic field homogeneity are presented. Results of simulations and experimental tests indicate that the presence of light access holes in the resonator's front side does not disturb the uniformity of microwave magnetic field distribution in the nodal plane. The optimal flat cell thickness for unsaturable and saturable aqueous samples has been calculated for this new structure.

  abstract = {Many studies have implicated a role for conformational motions during the catalytic cycle, acting to optimize the binding pocket or facilitate product release, but a more intimate role in the chemical reaction has not been described. We address this by monitoring active-site loop motion in two protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The PTPs, YopH and PTP1B, have very different catalytic rates; however, we find in both that the active-site loop closes to its catalytically competent position at rates that mirror the phosphotyrosine cleavage kinetics. This loop contains the catalytic acid, suggesting that loop closure occurs concomitantly with the protonation of the leaving group tyrosine and explains the different kinetics of two otherwise chemically and mechanistically indistinguishable enzymes.},

Recent work suggests that YZ and the metal site are intimately linked in the oxidation and deprotonation reactions of substrate water. The metal cluster stores oxidizing equivalents and provides binding sites for the substrate from which YZ• is proposed to abstract hydrogen atoms during the catalytic cycle of photosystem II. Intrinsic to this hydrogen-abstraction mechanism for water oxidation is an intimate structural and functional relationship between the metal site and YZ, which predicts that the local YZ environment will be sensitive to the composition and integrity of the metal cluster. To test this postulate, we have examined the YZ site and its status with respect to solvent exposure under varying degrees of disassembly of the oxygen-evolving complex. 1H$\backslash$2H-isoto...},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a universal regulatory protein that communicates the presence of calcium to its molecular targets and correspondingly modulates their function. This key signaling protein is important for controlling the activity of hundreds of membrane channels and transporters. However, understanding of the structural mechanisms driving CaM regulation of full-length membrane proteins has remained elusive. In this study, we determined the pseudoatomic structure of full-length mammalian aquaporin-0 (AQP0, Bos taurus) in complex with CaM, using EM to elucidate how this signaling protein modulates water-channel function. Molecular dynamics and functional mutation studies reveal how CaM binding inhibits AQP0 water permeability by allosterically closing the cytoplasmic gate of AQP0. Our mechanistic model provides new insight, only possible in the context of the fully assembled channel, into how CaM regulates multimeric channels by facilitating cooperativity between adjacent subunits.},

  abstract = {The function of many proteins involves equilibria between conformational substates, and to elucidate mechanisms of function it is essential to have experimental tools to detect the presence of conformational substates and to determine the time scale of exchange between them. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) has the potential to serve this purpose. In proteins containing a nitroxide side chain (R1), multicomponent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra can arise either from equilibria involving different conformational substates or rotamers of R1. To employ SDSL to uniquely identify conformational equilibria, it is thus essential to distinguish between these origins of multicomponent spectra. Here we show that this is possible based on the time scale for exchange of the nitroxide between distinct environments that give rise to multicomponent EPR spectra; rotamer exchange for R1 lies in the ≈0.1-1 $\mu$s range, while conformational exchange is at least an order of magnitude slower. The time scales of exchange events are determined by saturation recovery EPR, and in favorable cases, the exchange rate constants between substates with lifetimes of approximately 1-70 $\mu$s can be estimated by the approach.},

Although respectable absorption-mode spectra have been obtained previously by the artifice of "averaging" several FDM calculations, no 2D line list could be directly obtained from the averaged spectrum, and each calculation produced numerical artifacts that were demonstrably inconsistent with the measured data, but which could not be removed a posteriori. By regularizing the intrinsically ill-defined generalized eigenvalue problem that FDM poses, in a particular quite plausible way, features that are weak or stem from numerical problems are attenuated, allowing better characterization of the dominant spectral features.

  abstract = {A more robust way to obtain a high-resolution multidimensional NMR spectrum from limited data sets is described. The Filter Diagonalization Method (FDM) is used to analyze phase-modulated data and cast the spectrum in terms of phase-sensitive Lorentzian "phase-twist" peaks. These spectra are then used to obtain absorption-mode phase-sensitive spectra. In contrast to earlier implementations of multidimensional FDM, the absolute phase of the data need not be known beforehand, and linear phase corrections in each frequency dimension are possible, if they are required. Regularization is employed to improve the conditioning of the linear algebra problems that must be solved to obtain the spectral estimate. While regularization smoothes away noise and small peaks, a hybrid method allows the true noise floor to be correctly represented in the final result. Line shape transformation to a Gaussian-like shape improves the clarity of the spectra, and is achieved by a conventional Lorentzian-to-Gaussian transformation in the time-domain, after inverse Fourier transformation of the FDM spectra. The results obtained highlight the danger of not using proper phase-sensitive line shapes in the spectral estimate. The advantages of the new method for the spectral estimate are the following: (i) the spectrum can be phased by conventional means after it is obtained; (ii) there is a true and accurate noise floor; and (iii) there is some indication of the quality of fit in each local region of the spectrum. The method is illustrated with 2D NMR data for the first time, but is applicable to n-dimensional data without any restriction on the number of time/frequency dimensions.},

abstract = {The adsorption isotherms and 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts of xenon and the adsorption isotherms of carbon monoxide of Cu(II)- and Cu(I)-exchanged zeolites NaY were measured. The former zeolites of 53, 75, and 95{\%} exchange degrees were investigated after various pretreatment steps comprising dehydration, oxidation and reduction with CO at 420[degree sign]C as well as long-term CO reduction at 470[degree sign]C. The Cu(I)Y zeolite of 70{\%} exchange degree was prepared via a solid-state exchange procedure with CuCl and subjected to dehydration at 420[degree sign]C. In all cases, except the dehydrated zeolites, almost linear xenon adsorption isotherms and linear 129Xe NMR chemical shift versus xenon concentration curves running parallel to each other are obtained. In contrast, the chemical shift curves for the dehydrated zeolites are non-linear at low xenon concentrations turning towards negative chemical shift values at very low pressures. The whole body of the experimental xenon data can be explained quantitatively with a unifying approach on the basis of a site adsorption model where the sites are (i) two types of cuprous ions of much different adsorption strength and 129Xe chemical shift, (ii) Na+ cations, (iii) Lewis acid sites generated through autoreduction and reduction of Cu2+ by CO, and (iv) framework sites free of cations. These five types of sites are each characterized by Langmuir adsorption isotherm constants and local 129Xe NMR chemical shifts. The adsorption site concentrations in the various zeolites are evaluated. The supercage Cu(I) concentration values are in nice agreement with the results deduced from the CO adsorption isotherm measurements.},

This way the relative radial positioning of all probes was established and could be compared with those of 1-methyl-8-oxyquinolinium betaine (QB) and methyl orange (MO), previously used in the same systems. A continuous variation of the polarity in the RM was evidenced with different probes, from the most polar region in the center, with the polarity of ethanol/water mixts. (CAT 1, CAT 4 and QB) to a region corresponding to tetraethylene glycol (TG)/water mixts. and triethylene glycol monoethyl ether (TGME)/water mixts. (NP and CAT 8), to a region at the limits of the core, with the polarities of the triethylene glycol di-Me ether (TGDE)/water mixts. (MO) and to still lower values, found with the 16-doxyl probe, in the corona. At the same time, the different hydration dynamics at various depths in the micelles were followed showing earlier satn. in the outer regions of the core as compared to the central regions. The spin probes evidenced the compacting and ordering effects of water on the surfactant chains in the polar core and corona. From this point of view the RM in benzene-hexane appear to have a much lower viscosity in the polar core (over the whole range of water contents) as compared to those in cyclohexane. The order degree of the surfactant chains is lower too and the corona appears to be penetrable by an oil-sol. Cu complex, at variance with the cyclohexane system. All this data can be consistently explained by the loosening effect of benzene, solvating the surfactant chains in the corona. [on SciFinder (R)]},

From the spectral simulations the hyperfine coupling and nuclear quadrupolar coupling tensor components and the angles with respect to the quinone axes were obtained. Hydrogen bond lengths and geometries were deduced from the hyperfine couplings using the point-dipole model and from the nuclear quadrupolar couplings using empirical relationships.

The large computational effort associated with such modelling with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be avoided by a rotamer library approach based on a coarse-grained representation of the conformational space of the spin label. We show here that libraries of about 200 rotamers, obtained by iterative projection of a long MD trajectory of the free spin label onto a set of canonical dihedral angles, provide a representation of the underlying trajectory adequate for EPR distance measurements. Rotamer analysis was performed on selected X-ray structures of spin labelled T4 lysozyme mutants to characterize the spin label rotamer ensemble on a single protein site. Furthermore, predictions based on the rotamer library approach are shown to be in nearly quantitative agreement with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) distance data on the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NhaA and on the light-harvesting complex LHCII whose structures are known from independent cryo electron microscopy and X-ray studies, respectively. Suggestions for the selection of labelling sites in proteins are given, limitations of the approach discussed, and requirements for further development are outlined.},

A new micellization mechanism of block copolymers was realized by using the specific interaction between a low mol. wt. compd. and one of the blocks in low-polarity solvents. Many more successes have been achieved by our $\backslash$"block copolymer-free$\backslash$" strategies. We are now able to use homopolymers, random copolymers, oligomers, etc. as building blocks to construct noncovalently connected micelles (NCCM), in which the core and shell are connected by hydrogen bonding. Some of such NCCMs are readily converted further into hollow spheres by crosslinking the shell and then switching the medium to one that dissolves the core. Rigid polymer chains and their complementary homopolymers can directly assemble into large hollow spheres thanks to the propensity to parallel packing of the rigid chains. In addn., some of the NCCMs show perfect stimuli-responsive properties. PH-dependent micellization and pH-dependent micelle-hollow-sphere transition are realized in water-sol. graft copolymers driven by complexation and decomplexation between the main chain and grafts.

By systematically anchoring the hydrocarbon tails of a series of tryptophan-alkyl ester probes into the lipid bilayer, we mapped out with femtosecond resolution the profile of water motions across the nanochannel. Three distinct time scales were observed, revealing discrete channel water structures. The interfacial water at the lipid surface is well-ordered, and the relaxation dynamics occurs in approximately 100-150 ps. These dynamically rigid water molecules are crucial for global structural stability of lipid bilayers and for stabilization of anchored biomolecules in membranes. The adjacent water layers near the lipid interface are hydrogen-bonded networks and the dynamical relaxation takes 10-15 ps. This quasi-bound water motion, similar to the typical protein surface hydration relaxation, facilitates conformation flexibility for biological recognition and function. The water near the channel center is bulklike, and the dynamics is ultrafast in less than 1 ps. These water molecules freely transport biomolecules near the channel center. The corresponding orientational relaxation at these three typical locations is well correlated with the hydration dynamics and local dynamic rigidity. These results reveal unique water structures and dynamical motions in nanoconfinements, which is critical to the understanding of nanoscopic biological activities and nanomaterial properties.},

abstract = {A computer-aided analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of TEMPO radicals adsorbed in X zeolites is performed under various experimental conditions, both in the absence and in the presence of various species. In dehydrated NaX zeolites the radical gives rise to two superimposed signals corresponding to species characterized by different mobility and polarity and by a different temperature dependence. Controlled addition of water leads to an increase of mobility up to 4.2 water molecules per supercage. Under conditions of partial hydration, the radicals show an increase in the correlation time for motion with an increase in the size of the cation in the exchanged zeolites, whereas an increase in mobility is found upon going from NaX to NaY samples. These results are analyzed in terms of the variation of the local electric field at the surface. Dipolar broadening is shown to be responsible for the line shape variations found at TEMPO loadings up to 0.32 molecules per supercage. Heisenberg spin--spin interactions also become relevant at higher loading. Increasing amounts of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine induce a restriction of mobility. This result is interpreted in terms of a decrease in the free volume available to radicals which occupy the zeolite cavities. However, loading of pentane leads to a similar increase in mobility as found with increasing amounts of water. The environmental polarity, as expected, decreases due to the replacement of water molecules with pentane. It is proposed that the zeolite hosts, when saturated with pentane, slow moving radicals which are trapped in the pores.},

They recognize proteins, nucleic acids, and other types of partners; they accelerate interactions and chemical reactions between bound partners; and they help accommodate posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing, protein fusions, and insertions or deletions. Overall, IDP-associated biological activities complement those of structured proteins. Recently, there has been an explosion of studies on IDP regions and their functions, yet the discovery and investigation of these proteins have a long, mostly ignored history. Along with recent discoveries, we present several early examples and the mechanisms by which IDPs contribute to function, which we hope will encourage comprehensive discussion of IDPs and IDP regions in biochemistry textbooks.

Key basic processing of NMR data (e.g., Fourier transformation, baseline correction, and phasing) is catered for within the program, as well as more advanced techniques (e.g., reference deconvolution and pure shift FID reconstruction). Analysis tools include DOSY and SCORE for diffusion data, ROSY T1/T2 estimation for relaxation data, and PARAFAC for multilinear analysis. The GNAT is written for the MATLAB$\backslash$textregistered{\{}{\}}language and comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface. The standard version is intended to run with a MATLAB installation, but completely free-standing compiled versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux are also freely available.},

  abstract = {We present theoretical calculations of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) due to the cross effect in nuclear magnetic resonance under magic-angle spinning (MAS). Using a three-spin model (two electrons and one nucleus), cross effect DNP with MAS for electron spins with a large g-anisotropy can be seen as a series of spin transitions at avoided crossings of the energy levels, with varying degrees of adiabaticity. If the electron spin-lattice relaxation time T(1e) is large relative to the MAS rotation period, the cross effect can happen as two separate events: (i) partial saturation of one electron spin by the applied microwaves as one electron spin resonance (ESR) frequency crosses the microwave frequency and (ii) flip of all three spins, when the difference of the two ESR frequencies crosses the nuclear frequency, which transfers polarization to the nuclear spin if the two electron spins have different polarizations. In addition, adiabatic level crossings at which the two ESR frequencies become equal serve to maintain non-uniform saturation across the ESR line. We present analytical results based on the Landau-Zener theory of adiabatic transitions, as well as numerical quantum mechanical calculations for the evolution of the time-dependent three-spin system. These calculations provide insight into the dependence of cross effect DNP on various experimental parameters, including MAS frequency, microwave field strength, spin relaxation rates, hyperfine and electron-electron dipole coupling strengths, and the nature of the biradical dopants.},

  abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) employs paramagnetic species to increase the NMR signal of nuclear spins. In liquids, the efficiency of the effect depends on the strength of the interaction between the electron and nuclear spins and the time scales on which this interaction is modulated by the physical motion of the spin-bearing molecules. An approach to quantitatively predict the contribution of molecular motions to the DNP enhancement using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is developed and illustrated for the nitroxide radical TEMPOL in liquid toluene. A multi-resolution strategy that combines explicit treatment of the solvent at short distances from the free radical with implicit description at large intermolecular distances is adopted. Novel analytical expressions are obtained to correct for the finite spatial extent of the MD simulations. The atomistic and analytical descriptions are sewn seamlessly together by ensuring that for molecular trajectories that start in the near (explicit) region and end in the distant (implicit) region the analytical dipolar spectral densities reproduce the MD estimates. The spectral densities obtained from the developed approach are used to calculate DNP coupling factors separately for the ring and methyl protons of toluene. The agreement with previously reported experimental DNP data at a magnetic field of 3.4 T is noteworthy and encouraging. Maximum obtainable DNP enhancements at other magnetic fields are predicted.},

Molecular dynamics simulations show that solvent in the receptor pocket can fluctuate between wet and dry states with lifetimes in each state that are long enough for the extraction of a separable potential of mean force and wet-to-dry transitions. We present a diffusive surface hopping model that is represented by a 2D Markovian master equation. One dimension is the standard reaction coordinate, the ligand-pocket separation, and the other is the solvent state in the region between ligand and binding pocket which specifies whether it is wet or dry. In our model, the ligand diffuses on a dynamic free-energy surface which undergoes kinetic transitions between the wet and dry states. The model yields good agreement with results from explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation and an improved description of the kinetics of hydrophobic assembly. Furthermore, it is consistent with a "non-Markovian Brownian theory" for the ligand-pocket separation coordinate alone.},

In particular, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond have recently emerged as promising sensors of magnetic and electric fields. Although coherent control techniques have measured the amplitude of constant or oscillating fields, these techniques are not suitable for measuring time-varying fields with unknown dynamics. Here we introduce a coherent acquisition method to accurately reconstruct the temporal profile of time-varying fields using Walsh sequences. These decoupling sequences act as digital filters that efficiently extract spectral coefficients while suppressing decoherence, thus providing improved sensitivity over existing strategies. We experimentally reconstruct the magnetic field radiated by a physical model of a neuron using a single electronic spin in diamond and discuss practical applications. These results will be useful to implement time-resolved magnetic sensing with quantum probes at the nanometre scale.},

  abstract = {Nitroxide spin probes have been widely used to study the behavior of surfactants in soln. as well at solid-liq. interfaces. In this study the effect of temp. on the mobility of nitroxide spin probes in cyclohexane and at the alumina/cyclohexane interface is investigated in the presence of anionic aerosol-OT (AOT). The probe mobility in AOT micelles in soln. is markedly dependent on the amt. of solubilized water. The variation with temp. of the mobilities of adsorbed doxyl stearic acid with the nitroxide probe at the 5th, 10th, and 16th positions from the -COOH group has shed some light on the mechanisms of interaction of the probe with the solid surface as well as the mol. structure of the adsorbed layer. The results indicate that the adsorption of the probe occurs mainly through interactions of the -COOH group with the surface while the -NO group interacts only weakly with the surface. The adsorption of AOT causes changes in probe mobility with the changes being most significant when the nitroxide group on the stearic acid chain is farthest from the anchoring group. It is suggested that the adsorption of the surfactant causes an orientational rearrangement of the probe mols. The relatively low-temp. effect on the probe mobility obsd. in the presence of surfactant is attributed to the compactness of the adsorbed layer which is found to be stable even at elevated temps.

  abstract = {Phototropin is a light-regulated kinase that mediates a variety of photoresponses such as phototropism, chloroplast positioning, and stomata opening in plants to increase the photosynthetic efficiency. Blue light stimulus first induces local conformational changes in the chromophore-bearing light-oxygen and voltage 2 (LOV2) domain of phototropin, which in turn activates the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase domain in the C terminus. To examine the kinase activity of full-length phototropin conventionally, we employed the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this organism, Ser/Thr kinases (Fpk1p and Fpk2p) that show high sequence similarity to the kinase domain of phototropins exist. First, we demonstrated that the phototropin from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrPHOT) could complement loss of Fpk1p and Fpk2p to allow cell growth in yeast. Furthermore, this reaction was blue light-dependent, indicating that CrPHOT was indeed light-activated in yeast cells. We applied this system to a large scale screening for amino acid substitutions in CrPHOT that elevated the kinase activity in darkness. Consequently, we identified a cluster of mutations located in the N-terminal flanking region of LOV2 (R199C, L202L, D203N/G/V, L204P, T207I, and R210H). An in vitro phosphorylation assay confirmed that these mutations substantially reduced the repressive activity of LOV2 on the kinase domain in darkness. Furthermore, biochemical analyses of the representative T207I mutant demonstrated that the mutation affected neither spectral nor multimerization properties of CrPHOT. Hence, the N-terminal flanking region of LOV2, as is the case with the C-terminal flanking J$\alpha$ region, appears to play a crucial role in the regulation of kinase activity in phototropin.},

abstract = {Deuterium magnetic resonance spectra (55.26 MHz) of cholesterol-3 alpha-d1 and epicholesterol-3 beta-d1 in dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine (DPPC) liposomes were measured as a function of sterol-to-phospholipid ratio below (24 degrees C) and above (60 degrees C) the phase transition temperature of DPPC. From the quadrupolar splittings delta vq, the molecular order parameters S describing the motions of the sterols in the bilayer were calculated, and the most probable angle of tilt alpha 0 of the molecular axis of the sterols relative to the bilayer normal was determined. We observed that the molecular axis of cholesterol in DPPC liposomes at both 24 and 60 degrees C is tilted at an angle of 16-19 degrees with the 3 beta-hydroxyl group projecting parallel to the bilayer normal into the aqueous interface. In contrast, at 24 degrees C, epicholesterol is aligned parallel (0 degrees) to the bilayer normal, placing the 3 alpha-hydroxyl group essentially perpendicular to the bilayer normal along the aqueous interface. At 60 degrees C, the average angle of epicholesterol (16-18 degrees) is similar to that of cholesterol, which can project the 3 alpha-hydroxyl group into the hydrophobic bilayer region. On the basis of the observed tilt angles of the two isomeric sterols in DPPC liposomes, a model is proposed that can rationalize the differential effects of cholesterol and epicholesterol on membrane properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Solvent effects on magnetic parameters of nitroxide spin labels in combination with side-directed spin-labeling EPR methods provide very useful means for elucidating polarity profiles in lipid bilayers and mapping local electrostatic effects in complex biomolecular systems. One major contributor to these solvent effects is the hydrogen bonds that could be formed between the nitroxide moiety and water and/or the available hydroxyl groups. Here, formation of hydrogen bonds between a lipid bilayer spin probe5-doxyl stearic acid, 5DSAand hydrogen-bond donors has been studied using high-frequency (HF) pulsed ENDOR and EPR. A hydrogen-bonded deuteron was directly detected in HF ENDOR (130 GHz) spectra of 5DSA dissolved in several deuterated alcohols, while the characteristic signal was absent in nonpolar toluene-d8. The length of the hydrogen bond, 1.74 0.06 , and its geometry were found to be essentially the same for all four alcohols studied, indicating that nearly identical hydrogen bonds have been formed regardless of the solvent dielectric constant. This strengthens a hypothesis that HF EPR spectra are exclusively sensitive to formation of hydrogen bonds and could be used for probing the hydrogen-bond network in complex biomolecular assemblies and lipid bilayers with site-directed spin-labeling methods.},

By using Gd-containing CLaNP-3, relaxation effects were observed, allowing distances up to 30 A from the paramagnetic center to be determined accurately. Similar results were obtained with a Gd-DTPA (diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid) chelate, CLaNP-1, bound in the same bidentate manner to the protein.

  abstract = {The dynamical coupling between proteins and their hydration water is important for the understanding of macromolecular function in a cellular context. In the case of membrane proteins, the environment is heterogeneous, composed of lipids and hydration water, and the dynamical coupling might be more complex than in the case of the extensively studied soluble proteins. Here, we examine the dynamical coupling between a biological membrane, the purple membrane (PM), and its hydration water by a combination of elastic incoherent neutron scattering, specific deuteration, and molecular dynamics simulations. Examining completely deuterated PM, hydrated in H(2)O, allowed the direct experimental exploration of water dynamics. The study of natural abundance PM in D(2)O focused on membrane dynamics. The temperature-dependence of atomic mean-square displacements shows inflections at 120 K and 260 K for the membrane and at 200 K and 260 K for the hydration water. Because transition temperatures are different for PM and hydration water, we conclude that ps-ns hydration water dynamics are not directly coupled to membrane motions on the same time scale at temperatures {\textless}260 K. Molecular-dynamics simulations of hydrated PM in the temperature range from 100 to 296 K revealed an onset of hydration-water translational diffusion at approximately 200 K, but no transition in the PM at the same temperature. Our results suggest that, in contrast to soluble proteins, the dynamics of the membrane protein is not controlled by that of hydration water at temperatures {\textless}260 K. Lipid dynamics may have a stronger impact on membrane protein dynamics than hydration water.},

For proteins, molecules larger than 30 kDa require complex experimental methods, such as TROSY in conjunction with isotopic labeling schemes that are often expensive and generally reduce the potential information available. We have developed the reverse micelle encapsulation strategy as an alternative approach. Encapsulation of proteins within the protective nano-scale water pool of a reverse micelle dissolved in ultra-low viscosity nonpolar solvents overcomes the slow tumbling problem presented by large proteins. Here, we characterize the contributions from the various components of the protein-containing reverse micelle system to the rotational correlation time of the encapsulated protein. Importantly, we demonstrate that the protein encapsulated in the reverse micelle maintains a hydration shell comparable in size to that seen in bulk solution. Using moderate pressures, encapsulation in ultra-low viscosity propane or ethane can be used to magnify this advantage. We show that encapsulation in liquid ethane can be used to reduce the tumbling time of the 43 kDa maltose binding protein from {\~{}}23 to {\~{}}10 ns. These conditions enable, for example, acquisition of TOCSY-type data resolved on the adjacent amide NH for the 43 kDa encapsulated maltose binding protein dissolved in liquid ethane, which is typically impossible for proteins of such size without use of extensive deuteration or the TROSY effect.},

abstract = {Proteins tethered to solid supports are of increasing interest in bioanalytical chemistry and protein science in general. However, the extent to which tethering modifies the energy landscape and dynamics of the protein is most often unknown because there are few biophysical methods that can determine secondary and tertiary structures and explore conformational equilibria and dynamics of a tethered protein with site-specific resolution. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) offers a unique opportunity for this purpose. Here, we employ a general strategy using unnatural amino acids that enables efficient and site-specific tethering of a spin-labeled protein to a Sepharose solid support. Remarkably, EPR spectra of spin-labeled T4 lysozyme (T4L) reveal that a single site-specific attachment suppresses rotational motion of the protein sufficiently to allow interpretation of the spectral line shape in terms of protein internal dynamics. Importantly, line shape analysis and distance mapping using double electron-electron resonance reveal that internal dynamics, the tertiary fold, conformational equilibria, and ligand binding of the tethered proteins were similar to those in solution, in contrast to random attachment via native lysine residues. The results of this study set the stage for the development of an EPR-based flow system that will house soluble and membrane proteins immobilized site-specifically, thereby enabling facile screening of structural and dynamical effects of binding partners.},

This information is concluded from the principal components of the nitroxide Zeeman (g), nitrogen hyperfine (A) and quadrupole (P) tensors of the spin labels attached to specific sites. Recent multi-frequency high-field EPR studies underlined the complexity of the problem to treat the nitroxide microenvironment in proteins adequately due to inherent heterogeneities which result in several principal x-components of the nitroxide g-tensor. Concomitant, but distinctly different nitrogen hyperfine components could, however, not be determined from high-field cw EPR experiments owing to the large intrinsic EPR linewidth in fully protonated guest/host systems. It is shown in this work that, using the W-band (95GHz) ELDOR- (electron-electron double resonance) detected NMR (EDNMR) method, different principal nitrogen hyperfine, Azz, and quadrupole, Pzz, tensor values of a nitroxide radical in glassy 2-propanol matrix can be measured with high accuracy. They belong to nitroxides with different hydrogen-bond situations.

  abstract = {M2 from influenza A virus functions as an oligomeric proton channel essential for the viral cycle, hence it is a high-priority pharmacological target whose structure and functions require better understanding. We studied the mechanism of M2 transmembrane domain (M2TMD) assembly in lipid membranes by the powerful biophysical technique of double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. By varying the M2TMD-to-lipid molar ratio over a wide range from 1:18,800 to 1:160, we found that M2TMD exists as monomers, dimers, and tetramers whose relative populations shift to tetramers with the increase of peptide-to-lipid (P/L) molar ratio. Our results strongly support the tandem mechanism of M2 assembly that is monomers-to-dimer then dimers-to-tetramer, since tight dimers are abundant at small P/L's, and thereafter they assemble as dimers of dimers in weaker tetramers. The stepwise mechanism found for a single-pass membrane protein oligomeric assembly should contribute to the knowledge of the association steps in membrane protein folding.},

  abstract = {The measurement of spin-lattice relaxation rates from spin labels, such as nitroxides, in the presence and absence of spin relaxants provides information that is useful for determining biomolecular properties such as nucleic acid dynamics and the interaction of proteins with membranes. We compare X-band continuous wave (CW) and pulsed or time domain (TD) EPR methods for obtaining spin-lattice relaxation rates of spin labels across the entire range of rotational motion to which relaxation rates are sensitive. Model nitroxides and spin-labeled biological species are used to illustrate the potential complications that arise in extracting relaxation data under conditions typical to biological experiments. The effect of super hyperfine (SHF) structure is investigated for both CW and TD spectra. First and second harmonic absorption and dispersion CW spectra of the nitroxide spin label, TEMPOL, are all fit simultaneously to a model of SHF structure over a range of microwave amplitudes. The CW spectra are novel because all harmonics and microwave phases were acquired simultaneously using our homebuilt CW/TD spectrometer. The effect of the SHF structure on the pulsed free induction decay (FID) and pulsed saturation recovery spectrum is shown for both protonated and deuterated TEMPOL. We present novel pulsed saturation recovery measurements on biological molecules, including spin-lattice relaxation rates of spin-labeled proteins and spin-labeled double-stranded DNA. The impact of structure and dynamics on relaxation rates are discussed in the context of each of these examples. Collisional relaxation rates with oxygen and transition metal paramagnetic relaxants are extracted using both continuous wave and time domain methods. The extent of the errors inherent in the CW method and the advantages of pulsed methods for unambiguously measuring collisional relaxation rates are discussed. Spin-lattice relaxation rates, determined by both CW and pulsed methods, are used to determine the electrostatic potential on the surface of a protein.},

The observed EPR spectrum can be simulated reasonably well as overlap of spectra due to four magnetically inequivalent high-spin (HS) Fe(3+) ions (S = 5/2). The spectrum intensity is calculated, using the overlap I(BL) + (I(HS1)+I(HS2)+I(HS3)+I(HS4))xe(-0.00001xB), where B is the magnetic field intensity in Gauss, I represents the intensity of an EPR line (HS1, HS2, HS3, HS4), and BL stands for the base line. (The exponential factor, as found by fitting to the experimental spectrum, is related to the Boltzmann population distribution of energy levels at 255 K, which is the temperature of the sample in the spectrometer.) These high-frequency EPR results are significantly different from those at X-band. The large values of the zero-field splitting parameter (D) observed here for the four centers at the high frequency of 236 GHz are beyond the capability of X-band, which can only record spectra of ions only with much smaller D values than those reported here.},

  abstract = {Membrane proteins are critical functional molecules in the human body, constituting more than 30{\%} of open reading frames in the human genome. Unfortunately, a myriad of difficulties in overexpression and reconstitution into membrane mimetics severely limit our ability to determine their structures. Computational tools are therefore instrumental to membrane protein structure prediction, consequently increasing our understanding of membrane protein function and their role in disease. Here, we describe a general framework facilitating membrane protein modeling and design that combines the scientific principles for membrane protein modeling with the flexible software architecture of Rosetta3. This new framework, called RosettaMP, provides a general membrane representation that interfaces with scoring, conformational sampling, and mutation routines that can be easily combined to create new protocols. To demonstrate the capabilities of this implementation, we developed four proof-of-concept applications for (1) prediction of free energy changes upon mutation; (2) high-resolution structural refinement; (3) protein-protein docking; and (4) assembly of symmetric protein complexes, all in the membrane environment. Preliminary data show that these algorithms can produce meaningful scores and structures. The data also suggest needed improvements to both sampling routines and score functions. Importantly, the applications collectively demonstrate the potential of combining the flexible nature of RosettaMP with the power of Rosetta algorithms to facilitate membrane protein modeling and design.},

  abstract  = {In photosynthetic oxygen evolution, redox active tyrosine Z (YZ) plays an essential role in proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Four sequential photooxidation reactions are necessary to produce oxygen at a Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster. The sequentially oxidized states of this oxygen-evolving cluster (OEC) are called the S(n) states, where n refers to the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. The neutral radical, YZ•, is generated and then acts as an electron transfer intermediate during each S state transition. In the X-ray structure, YZ, Tyr161 of the D1 subunit, is involved in an extensive hydrogen bonding network, which includes calcium-bound water. In electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, we measured the YZ• recombination rate, in the presence of an intact Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster. We compared the S(0) and S(2) states, which differ in Mn oxidation state, and found a significant difference in the YZ• decay rate (t(1/2) = 3.3 ± 0.3 s in S(0); t(1/2) = 2.1 ± 0.3 s in S(2)) and in the solvent isotope effect (SIE) on the reaction (1.3 ± 0.3 in S(0); 2.1 ± 0.3 in S(2)). Although the YZ site is known to be solvent accessible, the recombination rate and SIE were pH independent in both S states. To define the origin of these effects, we measured the YZ• recombination rate in the presence of ammonia, which inhibits oxygen evolution and disrupts the hydrogen bond network. We report that ammonia dramatically slowed the YZ• recombination rate in the S(2) state but had a smaller effect in the S(0) state. In contrast, ammonia had no significant effect on YD•, the stable tyrosyl radical. Therefore, the alterations in YZ• decay, observed with S state advancement, are attributed to alterations in OEC hydrogen bonding and consequent differences in the YZ midpoint potential/pK(a). These changes may be caused by activation of metal-bound water molecules, which hydrogen bond to YZ. These observations document the importance of redox control in proton-coupled electron transfer reactions.},

Using methyl-transverse relaxation-optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we present an atomic-resolution model for the ClpB-DnaK complex, which we verified by mutagenesis and functional assays. ClpB and GrpE compete for binding to the DnaK nucleotide binding domain, with GrpE binding inhibiting disaggregation. DnaK, in turn, plays a dual role in both disaggregation and subsequent refolding of polypeptide chains as they emerge from the aggregate.

Escherichia coli GroEL has a symmetric double-toroid architecture, which binds nonnative polypeptide substrates on the hydrophobic walls of its central cavity. The asymmetric binding of ATP and cochaperonin GroES to GroEL triggers a major conformational change in the cis ring, creating an enlarged chamber into which the bound nonnative polypeptide is released. The structural changes that create the cis assembly also change the lining of the cavity wall from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, conducive to folding into the native state. ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring weakens it and primes the release of products. When ATP and GroES bind to the trans ring, it forms a stronger assembly, which disassembles the cis complex through negative cooperativity between rings. The opposing function of the two rings operates as if the system had two cylinders, one expelling the products of the reaction as the other loads up the reactants. One cycle of the reaction gives the polypeptide about 15 s to fold at the cost of seven ATP molecules. For some proteins, several cycles of GroEL assistance may be needed in order to achieve their native states.},

In this review we describe state-of-the-art HD-ODNP methods and experiments, and identify technological and conceptual advances necessary to broadly disseminate HD-ODNP, as well as broaden its scope. Specifically, incomplete treatment of the saturation factor leads to the use of high microwave powers that induce temperature-dependent effects in HD-ODNP that can be detrimental to the stability and property of the sample and/or data interpretation, and thus must be corrected for. Furthermore, direct measurements of the electron spin relaxation times for the nitroxide radical-based spin labels used in HD-ODNP have recently caught up with the ambient solution conditions of relevance to HD-ODNP experiment, allowing us to envision an explicit treatment of the saturation factor. This would enable “single-shot” HD-ODNP at one or two concentrations and power levels, cutting down experimental times from the typical hours to minutes. With the development of a user-friendly and robust operation, the application of HD-ODNP experiments can be broadened for the study of biomolecules, biomaterials, soft polymer materials (i.e. hydrogels) and surfaces. In fact, any hydrated materials that can be viably spin labeled can yield information on local water dynamics and interfaces, and so guide the design of soft materials for medical and pharmaceutical uses. A brief introduction to spin-labeling, and exemplary applications to soft materials is discussed to serve as inspiration for future studies.},

For ubiquitin, the total change in entropy is T$\Delta$STotal = 1.4 kcal⋅mol(-1) per residue at 300 K with only 20{\%} from the loss of side-chain entropy. Our analysis exhibits mixed agreement with prior studies because of the use of more accurate ensembles and contributions from correlated motions. Buried side chains lose only a factor of 1.4 in the number of conformations available per rotamer upon folding ($\Omega$U/$\Omega$N). The entropy loss for helical and sheet residues differs due to the smaller motions of helical residues (T$\Delta$Shelix-sheet = 0.5 kcal⋅mol(-1)), a property not fully reflected in the amide N-H and carbonyl C=O bond NMR order parameters. The results have implications for the thermodynamics of folding and binding, including estimates of solvent ordering and microscopic entropies obtained from NMR.},

For a normally hydrated sample, this occurs at about 230 K, where a dynamical transition from a low-temperature harmonic regime is observed. In moderately dry samples, on the other hand, in which the photocycle is slowed down by several orders of magnitude, no transition is observed and protein motions remain approximately harmonic up to room temperature. These results support the hypothesis, made from previous neutron diffraction studies, that the "softness" of the membrane modulates the function of bacteriorhodopsin by allowing or not allowing large-amplitude motions in the protein.},

abstract = {By means of differential scanning calorimetry and from a review of published data we demonstrate in this work that low-molecular weight kosmotropic substances (water-structure makers) of different chemical structure such as disaccharides, proline, and glycerol have identical effects on the phase behavior of several kinds of phospholipids and glycolipids. These substances favor formation of the high-temperature inverted hexagonal phase (H(II)) and the low-temperature lamellar crystalline (L(c)) and gel (L( $\beta$ )) phases at the expense of the intermediate lamellar liquid-crystalline phase (L( $\alpha$ )). The latter phase may completely disappear from the phase diagram at high enough solute concentration. By contrast, chaotropic substances (water-structure breakers) such as sodium thiocyanate and guanidine hydrochloride expand the existence range of L( $\alpha$ ) at the expense of the adjacent L( $\beta$ ) and H(II) phases. Moreover, chaotropes are able to induce the appearance of missing intermediate liquid-crystalline phases in lipids displaying direct L( $\beta$ )→H(II) transitions in pure water. In previous publications we have considered the influence of chaotropic and kosmotropic substances on the lipid phase behavior as a manifestation of their indirect (Hofmeister) interactions with the lipid aggregates. For a quantitative characterization of this effect, here we derive a general thermodynamic equation between lipid phase transition temperature and solute concentration, analogous to the Clapeyron-Clausius equation between transition temperature and pressure. It provides a clear description in physical quantities of the disparate effects of kosmotropic and chaotropic substances on the relative stability of the lipid-water phases. According to this equation, the magnitude of the solute effect is proportional to the hydration difference of the adjacent lipid phases and inversely proportional to the transition latent heat. The sign and magnitude of the transition shifts depend also on the degree of solute depletion (for kosmotropes) or enrichment (for chaotropes) at the interfaces, in comparison to the solute concentration in bulk water.},

To this purpose, some modifications of the cell standard structure are mandatory, starting from its flexibilization. Among all, electrolytes based on self-standing membranes may be the best option for the fabrication of flexible, efficient and durable devices. Thus, we report on an innovative combination of vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes, grown onto bendable titanium mesh, and a photocured polymer electrolyte membrane to fabricate a flexible DSSC. The photovoltaic performances were deeply investigated by electrical measurements and impedance spectroscopy, and the electrochemical behavior of the TiO2- and polymer-based membranes is reported. The careful selection of the materials and the synergistic effect of the two membrane properties led to the most efficient quasi-solid flexible DSSC ever produced, with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency equal to 3.4{\%} under 1 sun irradiation.},

abstract = {Imaging of free radicals in vivo using an interleaved field-cycled proton-electron double-resonance imaging (FC-PEDRI) pulse sequence has recently been studied. To reduce the EPR (ESR) irradn. power required and the imaging time, a centric reordered snapshot FC-PEDRI pulse sequence was implemented. This is based on the FLASH pulse sequence with a very short repetition time and the use of centric reordering of the phase-encoding gradient, allowing the most significant free induction decay (FID) signals to be collected before the signal enhancement decays significantly. A new technique of signal phase-shift correction was required to eliminate ghost artifacts caused by the instability of the main magnetic field after field cycling. An FID amplitude correction scheme also was implemented to reduce edge enhancement artifacts caused by the rapid change of magnetization population before reaching the steady state. Using the rapid pulse sequence, the time required for acquisition of a 64 * 64 pixel FC-PEDRI image was reduced to 6 s per image compared with .apprx.2.5 min with the conventional pulse sequence. The EPR irradn. power applied to the sample was reduced by a factor of .apprx.64. Although the resulting images obtained by the rapid pulse sequence have a lower signal to noise than those obtained by a normal interleaved FC-PEDRI pulse sequence, rapid imaging of free radicals in vivo using snapshot FC-PEDRI is possible.

  abstract = {Surfactants are known to stabilize proteins and are often employed as additives in protein formulations. We have developed a method to study the interaction of these formulation additives with proteins by using the partitioning behavior of a spin label. In protein-free formulations, 16-doxyl stearic acid partitions into micelles above the crit. micelle concn. (CMC) of the surfactant and gives rise to composite ESR spectra compared to spectra from $\backslash$"free$\backslash$" label and $\backslash$"rotationally hinder$\backslash$" label. We compute the fraction of micelle-assocd. label by factor anal. and generate a label partition curve. When protein is added to the formulation, surfactant-protein aggregates form at concns. below the surfactant's CMC. Partitioning of the label into these aggregates causes the EPR spectrum to reflect hindered rotation of the label at lower surfactant concns. than in the protein-free solns. A simple model of labeling partitioning shows that these partitioning shifts can be correlated to the surfactant:protein binding stoichiometry. We have studied the interactions of various non-ionic surfactants like Brij and Tween with recombinant human growth hormone and recombinant human interferon-g and obtained corresponding binding stoichiometries. These binding stoichiometries match those obtained by other techniques. This technique offers a new method for estg. the protein:surfactant binding stoichiometries. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The distance between the 20th and the 35th cysteine was estimated in doubly spin labeled human ubiquitin. Pulsed DEER requires two microwave sources. However, a phase cycle is not usually required in this method. On the other hand, DQC-ESR at X-band ( approximately 9GHz) can acquire a large echo signal by using pulses of short duration and high power, but this method has an ESEEM (electron spin echo envelope modulation) problem.

  abstract = {Human cell division cycle protein 42 (Cdc42Hs) is a small, Rho-type guanosine triphosphatase involved in multiple cellular processes through its interactions with downstream effectors. The binding domain of one such effector, the actin cytoskeleton-regulating p21-activated kinase 3, is known as PBD46. Nitrogen-15 backbone and carbon-13 methyl NMR relaxation was measured to investigate the dynamical changes in activated GMPPCP{\textperiodcentered}Cdc42Hs upon PBD46 binding. Changes in internal motion of the Cdc42Hs, as revealed by methyl axis order parameters, were observed not only near the Cdc42Hs-PBD46 interface but also in remote sites on the Cdc42Hs molecule. The binding-induced changes in side-chain dynamics propagate along the long axis of Cdc42Hs away from the site of PBD46 binding with sharp distance dependence. Overall, the binding of the PBD46 effector domain on the dynamics of methyl-bearing side chains of Cdc42Hs results in a modest rigidification, which is estimated to correspond to an unfavorable change in conformational entropy of approximately -10kcalmol(-1) at 298K. A cluster of methyl probes closest to the nucleotide-binding pocket of Cdc42Hs becomes more rigid upon binding of PBD46 and is proposed to slow the catalytic hydrolysis of the $\gamma$ phosphate moiety. An additional cluster of methyl probes surrounding the guanine ring becomes more flexible on binding of PBD46, presumably facilitating nucleotide exchange mediated by a guanosine exchange factor. In addition, the Rho insert helix, which is located at a site remote from the PBD46 binding interface, shows a significant dynamic response to PBD46 binding.},

SCOPE OF REVIEW: Our goal here is to summarize the contribution of molecular simulations to our current understanding of normal and aberrant Ras function. We focus on lessons from molecular dynamics simulations in aqueous and membrane environments.

MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The central message is that a close interaction between theory and simulation on the one hand and cell-biological, spectroscopic and other experimental approaches on the other has played, and will likely continue to play, a vital role in Ras research.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Atomistic insights emerging from detailed simulations of Ras in solution and in bilayers may be the key to unlock the secret that to date prevented development of selective anti-Ras inhibitors for cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. The emerging Overhauser effect dynamic nuclear polarization (OD NP) technique measures the translational mobility of water within the vicinity (5-15 {\AA}) of preselected sites. The work presented here expands the capabilities of the ODNP technique and illuminates an important, previously unseen, property of the translational diffusion dynamics of water at the surface of DNA duplexes. We attach nitroxide radicals (i.e., spin labels) to multiple phosphate backbone positions of DNA duplexes, allowing ODNP to measure the hydration dynamics at select positions along the DNA surface. With a novel approach to ODNP analysis, we isolate the contributions of water molecules at these sites that undergo free translational diffusion from water molecules that either loosely bind to or exchange protons with the DNA. The results reveal that a significant population of water in a localized volume adjacent to the DNA surface exhibits fast, bulk-like characteristics and moves unusually rapidly compared to water found in similar probe volumes near protein and membrane surfaces. Control studies show that the observation of these characteristics are upheld even when the DNA duplex is tethered to streptavidin or the mobility of the nitroxides is altered. This implies that, as compared to protein or lipid surfaces, it is an intrinsic feature of the DNA duplex surface that it interacts only weakly with a significant fraction of the surface hydration water network. The displacement of this translationally mobile water is energetically less costly than that of more strongly bound water by up to several k B T and thus can lower the activation barrier for interactions involving the DNA surface.},

abstract = {The earliest stages of phase separation in a liquid triethylamine (TEA)-water mixture were observed using a picosecond IR laser pulse to produce a temperature jump and ultrafast Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectral changes in the water OH stretching region showed that the temperature rise induced by IR pulses equilibrated within a few tens of picoseconds. Amplitude changes in the TEA CH-stretching region of difference Raman spectra consisted of an initial faster and a subsequent slower process. The faster process within 100 ps is attributed to hydrogen bond weakening caused by the temperature rise. The slower process attributed to phase separation was observed for several nanoseconds, showing the number of hydrogen bond between TEA and water gradually decreased with time. The kinetics of hydrogen bond scission during phase separation indicated a linear growth of the phase-separated component, as observed previously on the nanosecond time scale, rather than the more usual exponential growth. A peak blueshift was observed in the difference Raman spectra during phase separation. This shift implies that hydrogen bond scission of TEA-water aggregates involving very few water molecules took place in the initial stage of phase separation (up to 2 ns), and then was followed by the breaking of TEA-water pairs surrounded by water molecules. This effect may be a result from spatial inhomogeneities associated with the phase separation process: aggregates or clusters existing naturally in solution even below the lower critical soluble temperature.},

In these methods, protein dynamics are obtained by analyzing relaxation dispersion curves obtained from either changing the time spacing between 180 degree pulses or by changing the effective spin-locking field strength. In this Communication, we introduce a new method to induce a dispersion of relaxation rates. Our approach relies on altering the shape of the adiabatic full passage pulse and is conceptually different from existing approaches. By changing the nature of the adiabatic radiofrequency irradiation, we are able to obtain rotating frame R(1rho) and R(2rho) dispersion curves that are sensitive to slow micros/ms protein dynamics (demonstrated with ubiquitin). The strengths of this method are to (a) extend the dynamic range of the relaxation dispersion analysis, (b) avoid the need for multiple magnetic field strengths to extract dynamic parameters, (c) measure accurate relaxation rates that are independent of frequency offset, and (d) reduce the stress to NMR hardware (e.g., cryoprobes).},

To determine the electronic structure of the Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster, pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) measurements were performed for the tyrosine residue Y(D)() and S(2) state signals with non-oriented and oriented photosystem II (PS II) samples. Based on these measurements, the spin density distributions were calculated by comparing with the experimental results. The best fitting parameters were obtained with a model in which Mn1 has a large positive projection, Mn3 has a small positive projection, and Mn2 and Mn4 have negative projections (the numbering of Mni (i=1-4) is based on the crystal structure at a 1.9{\AA} resolution), which yielded spin projections of 1.97, -1.20, 1.19 and -0.96 for Mn1-4 ions. The results show that the Mn1 ion, which is coordinated by H332, D342 and E189, has a valence of Mn(III) in the S(2) state. The sign of the exchange interactions J(13) is positive, and the other signs are negative.},

Stable nitroxides of imidazoline and imidazolidine types provide the unique possibility of measuring local values of pH and glutathione content in various biological systems, including in vivo studies. The basis for these applications is the observation of specific chemical reactions of these nitroxides with protons or thiols, followed by significant changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of these probes, measured by low-frequency EPR techniques. The applications of some newly developed pH and SH probes in model systems of pharmacological interest, biological fluids, tissues, and cells as well as in vivo studies in isolated hearts and in the gut of living animals are discussed.},

The vis-pump/vis-probe experiments show a kinetic isotope effect that is more pronounced for alkaline conditions, thus decreasing the previously reported pH-dependence of the primary reaction of proteorhodopsin in H2O. This points to a pH dependent H-bonding network in the binding pocket of proteorhodopsin, that directly influences the primary photo-induced dynamics. The vis-pump/IR-probe experiments were carried out in two different spectral regions and allowed to monitor the retinal CC (1500 cm-1-1580 cm-1) and CN stretching vibration as well as the amide I mode of the protein (1590 cm-1-1680 cm-1). Like the FTIR spectra of the K intermediate (PRK-PR difference spectra) in this spectral range, the kinetic parameters and also the quantum efficiency of photo-intermediate formation are found to be virtually independent of the pD value.},

In an Arrhenius plot, ln $\eta$ vs 1/T, a strong liquid shows linear behavior whereas a fragile liquid exhibits an upward curvature [super-Arrhenius (SA) behavior], a situation customarily described by using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law. Here we analyze existing data of the transport coefficients of 84 glass-forming liquids. We show the data are consistent, on decreasing temperature, with the onset of a well-defined dynamical crossover $\eta$(×), where $\eta$(×) has the same value, $\eta$(×) ≈ 10(3) Poise, for all 84 liquids. The crossover temperature, T(×), located well above the calorimetric glass transition temperature T(g), marks significant variations in the system thermodynamics, evidenced by the change of the SA-like T dependence above T(×) to Arrhenius behavior below T(×). We also show that below T(×) the familiar Stokes-Einstein relation D/T ∼ $\eta$(-1) breaks down and is replaced by a fractional form D/T ∼ $\eta$(-$\zeta$), with $\zeta$ ≈ 0.85.},

It was found that the dynamic properties of the mixture are significantly improved by adding even a small amount of water. Detailed analysis on the solvation structure in the mixtures reveals that water molecules can break the strong interaction between MT and LT, and thus the ions can move more freely. As a result, the ionic conductivity of the catholyte mixtures increases with increasing water molar ratio in the water concentration range covered in the current work. The performance of the catholyte mixture systems was also tested in battery cells. The best utility efficiency of the capacity was found for the mixture of water:MT:LT ratio at 5.3:1:1. Water molar ratios of 5 to 6 were also found to be the lowest concentration at which MT and LT are fully saturated by water. These results provide insightful understanding of the performance of these battery catholytes.},

Here, we report the results of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic investigations of the binding of amino- and thiolo-HMBPP (HMBPP=E-1-hydroxy-2-methyl-but-2-enyl 4-diphosphate) IspH substrate-analog inhibitors to both proteins, as well as the binding of HMBPP and an acetylene diphosphate inhibitor, to IspG. The results show that amino-HMBPP binds to reduced IspH by Fe-C $\pi$-bonding with the olefinic carbons interacting with the unique 4(th) Fe in the 4Fe-4S cluster, quite different to the direct Fe-N ligation seen with the oxidized protein. No such $\pi$-complex is observed when amino-HMBPP binds to reduced IspG. No EPR signal is observed with IspH in the presence of dithionite and thiolo-HMBPP, suggesting that the 4Fe-4S cluster is not reduced, consistent with the presence of a 420 nm feature in the absorption spectrum (characteristic of an oxidized cluster). However, with IspG, the EPR spectrum in the presence of dithionite and thiolo-HMBPP is very similar to that seen with HMBPP. The binding of HMBPP to IspG was studied using hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy with (17)O and (13)C labeled samples: the results rule out direct Fe-O bonding and indicate $\pi$-bonding. Finally, the binding to IspG of a potent acetylene diphosphate inhibitor was studied by using electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy with (13)C labeled ligands: the large hyperfine couplings indicate strong Fe-C $\pi$-bonding with the acetylenic group. These results illustrate a remarkable diversity in binding behavior for HMBPP-analog inhibitors, opening up new routes to inhibitor design of interest in the context of anti-bacterial and anti-malarial drug discovery, as well as "cubane-type" metallo-biochemistry, in general.},

  abstract = {The effects of binding of myristoylated ADP ribosylation factor 6  (myr-ARF6), an activator of phospholipase D (PLD), to a model membrane  were investigated using an electron spin resonance (ESR) labeling  technique. Initial studies were conducted in vesicles composed of  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine,  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate  (PIP(2)), and cholesterol. Recombinant ARF6 binding significantly  enhances defects in both the headgroup and acyl-chain regions of the  membrane, which are revealed by the emergence of sharp components in  the spectra from a headgroup label,  1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy-choline  (DPPTC), and a chain label, 10PC, after myr-ARF6 binding. Binding of  non-myristoylated ARF6 (non-ARF6) shows markedly reduced effects.  Interestingly, no change in spectra from DPPTC was observed upon  myr-ARF6 binding when PIP(2) in the vesicles was replaced by other  negatively charged lipids, including phosphatidylinositol,  phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol, even when normalized for  charge. The production of the sharp peak appears to be a specific  event, because another GTP binding protein, CDC42, which binds PIP(2)  and activates PLD, fails to induce changes in vesicle structure. These  results suggest a previously unappreciated role for ARF in mediating a  protein/lipid interaction that produces defects in lipid bilayers. This  function may serve as an initial event in destabilizing membrane  structure for subsequent membrane fusion or biogenesis of vesicles.},

Results are compared to the electrostatic energy calculations for the primitive polarization model (PPM) of hydrated cations describing the ion hydration shell as a dielectric sphere of low permittivity (Gavryushov, S.; Linse, P. J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 7135). Parameters of the ion dielectric sphere and radius of the macroion/water dielectric boundary were extracted by means of this comparison to approximate the short-range repulsion of ions near the interface. To explore the counterion distributions around a simplified model of DNA, the obtained PPM parameters for Na+ and Ca2+ have been substituted into the modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) equations derived for the PPM and named the epsilon-MPB (epsilon-MPB) theory. epsilon-MPB results for DNA suggest that such polarization effects are important in the case of 2:1 electrolyte and highly charged macromolecules. The three-dimensional implementation of the epsilon-MPB theory was also applied to calculation of the energies of interaction between two parallel macromolecules of DNA in solutions of NaCl and CaCl2. Being compared to results of MPB calculations without the ion polarization effects, it suggests that the ion hydration shell polarization and inhomogeneous solvent permittivity might be essential factors in the experimentally known hydration forces acting between charged macromolecules and bilayers at separations of less than 20 A between their surfaces.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a unique class of proteins that have no stable native structure, a feature that allows them to adopt a wide variety of extended and compact conformations that facilitate a large number of vital physiological functions. One of the most well-known IDPs is the microtubule-associated tau protein, which regulates microtubule growth in the nervous system. However, dysfunctions in tau can lead to tau oligomerization, fibril formation, and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease. Using a combination of simulations and experiments, we explore the role of osmolytes in regulating the conformation and aggregation propensities of the R2/wt peptide, a fragment of tau containing the aggregating paired helical filament (PHF6*). We show that the osmolytes urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) shift the population of IDP monomer structures, but that no new conformational ensembles emerge. Although urea halts aggregation, TMAO promotes the formation of compact oligomers (including helical oligomers) through a newly proposed mechanism of redistribution of water around the perimeter of the peptide. We put forth a "superposition of ensembles" hypothesis to rationalize the mechanism by which IDP structure and aggregation is regulated in the cell.},

The double-shell model, in which an equivalent shell of thylakoid was assumed inside the cytoplasm, was adopted to describe the special morphology of the protoplast. Under the assumption that the conductivity of plasmalemma was negligible and the conductivity of the equivalent shell was 0.1 microS/cm, we attempted to estimate the dielectric properties of various protoplast components by fitting theoretical curve to experimental data. The relative permittivity of the plasmalemma epsilon(mem) was estimated to be 6.5+/-0.5, and the permittivity of the equivalent shell of thylakoid epsilon(thy) was estimated to be about 3.2+/-0.2. The permittivity epsilon(cyt) and conductivity kappa(cyt) of the cytoplasm were estimated to be 60 and 0.88+/-0.11 mS/cm, respectively.

In this paper, we report the crystal structure of Fragaceatoxin C (FraC), a PFT isolated from the sea anemone Actinia fragacea, at 1.8 {\AA} resolution. It consists of a crown-shaped nonamer with an external diameter of about 11.0 nm and an internal diameter of approximately 5.0 nm. Cryoelectron microscopy studies of FraC in lipid bilayers reveal the pore structure that traverses the membrane. The shape and dimensions of the crystallographic oligomer are fully consistent with the membrane pore. The FraC structure provides insight into the interactions governing the assembly process and suggests the structural changes that allow for membrane insertion. We propose a nonameric pore model that spans the membrane by forming a lipid-free $\alpha$-helical bundle pore.},

In particular, compared to other techniques, laser microfabrication can realize special modulation ranging from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic without the assistance of fluorination, allowing much more freedom to achieve complex multiple-wettability integration. The current challenges and future research prospects of this rapidly developing field are also being discussed.

Its orientational order in the nematic phase of the liquid crystal solvent 4,4′-azoxyanisole (PAA) has been measured from the variation of the EPR spectral parameters on passing from the isotropic to the nematic phase. Highly resolved EPR lines allow for precise evaluation of the shifts of the g, a N and a H values. Since the g and the hyperfine tensors are known, the order matrix could be obtained. This is compared with the one calculated with a theoretical model based on short range solute-solvent interactions, which predicts a considerable degree of orientation of the molecular axes, despite the almost spherical shape of the molecule. The agreement with experimental findings is quite good and it is further improved if a bent structure of the pyrrolidine ring is taken into account.},

In all Class Ia RNRs, initiation of nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) reduction requires a reversible oxidation over 35 {\AA} by a tyrosyl radical (Y122•, Escherichia coli) in subunit $\beta$ of a cysteine (C439) in the active site of subunit $\alpha$. This radical transfer (RT) occurs by a specific pathway involving redox active tyrosines (Y122 ⇆ Y356 in $\beta$ to Y731 ⇆ Y730 ⇆ C439 in $\alpha$); each oxidation necessitates loss of a proton coupled to loss of an electron (PCET). To study these steps, 3-aminotyrosine was site-specifically incorporated in place of Y356-$\beta$, Y731- and Y730-$\alpha$, and each protein was incubated with the appropriate second subunit $\beta$($\alpha$), CDP and effector ATP to trap an amino tyrosyl radical (NH2Y•) in the active $\alpha$2$\beta$2 complex. High-frequency (263 GHz) pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the NH2Y•s reported the gx values with unprecedented resolution and revealed strong electrostatic effects caused by the protein environment. (2)H electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy accompanied by quantum chemical calculations provided spectroscopic evidence for hydrogen bond interactions at the radical sites, i.e., two exchangeable H bonds to NH2Y730•, one to NH2Y731• and none to NH2Y356•. Similar experiments with double mutants $\alpha$-NH2Y730/C439A and $\alpha$-NH2Y731/Y730F allowed assignment of the H bonding partner(s) to a pathway residue(s) providing direct evidence for colinear PCET within $\alpha$. The implications of these observations for the PCET process within $\alpha$ and at the interface are discussed.},

By introducing a novel contrast medium (CM) based on a single electron substance, it is possible to enhance the proton signal through the Overhauser effect. A low-field magnetic resonance scanner is used to image the proton nuclei of the object. The electron spin transition of the CM is saturated using rf irradiation. As a consequence, the nuclear polarization becomes enhanced through dipole-dipole interaction. The signal enhancement is a function of rf power and of the EPR line width of the substance, which is influenced by the oxygen concentration. The maximum in vivo enhancement has been measured to 60. Image data, generated with different scanning parameters, is used in a postprocessing method to generate images showing pO2 and the contrast medium concentration, respectively. The mathematical foundation of the postprocessing algorithm is outlined. The results from phantom experiments and animal experiments, in which the oxygen content of the inspired gas was varied, are presented. The potential for human imaging is discussed. J. Magn. Reson.

This review provides examples that illustrate strategies for interpreting the data in terms of specific rearrangements in secondary and tertiary structure. The changes in the mobility and solvent accessibility of the spin label side chains, and in the distances between spin labels, report (i) rigid body motions of alpha-helices and beta-strands (ii) relative movements of domains and (iii) changes in secondary structure. Such events can be monitored in the millisecond time-scale, making it possible to follow structural changes during function. There is no upper limit to the size of proteins that can be investigated, and only 50-100 picomoles of protein are required. These features make site-directed spin labeling an attractive approach for the study of structure and dynamics in a wide range of systems.},

It was inferred that the medium pH, which significantly modifies the protein net charge and (presumably) conformation, modulates the mutual interactions with carbon nanotubes. At fixed pH, in addition, the formation of protein/nanotube complexes scales with increasing lysozyme concentration. Electrophoretic mobility, dielectric relaxation and circular dichroism were used to determine the above features. According to circular dichroism, lysozyme adsorbed onto nanotubes could essentially retain its native conformation, but the significant amount of free protein does not allow drawing definitive conclusions on this regard. The state of charge and charge distribution around nanotubes was inferred by combining electrophoretic mobility and dielectric relaxation methods. The former gives information on changes in the surface charge density of the complexes, the latter on modifications in the electrical double layer thickness around them. Such results are complementary each other and univocally indicate that some LYS molecules take part to binding. Above a critical protein/nanotube mass ratio, depletion phenomena were observed. They counteract the stabilization mechanism, with subsequent nanotube/nanotube aggregation and phase separation. Protein-based depletion phenomena are similar to formerly reported effects, observed in aqueous surfactant systems containing carbon nanotubes.},

abstract = {Abstract   13C homonuclear correlation spectra based on proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD) are becoming increasingly important for obtaining distance constraints from multiply labeled biomolecules by MAS NMR. One particular challenging situation arises when such constraints are to be obtained from spectra with a large natural abundance signal background which causes detrimental diagonal peak intensities. They obscure cross peaks, and furthermore impede the calculation of a buildup rates matrix which may be used to derive distance constraints, as carried out in “NMR crystallography”. Here, we combine double quantum (DQ) filtering with 13C–13C dipolar assisted rotational resonance (DARR) experiments to yield correlation spectra free of natural abundance contributions. Two experimental schemes, using DQ filtering prior to evolution (DOPE), and after mixing (DOAM), have been evaluated. Diagonal peak intensities along the spectrum diagonal are removed completely, and crosspeaks close to the diagonal are easily identifiable. For DOAM spectra with negligible mixing times, it is possible to carry out ‘assignment walks' which simplify peak identification substantially. The method is demonstrated on 13C-cys labeled proteorhodopsin, a 27 kDa membrane protein. The magnetization transfer characteristics were studied using buildup curves obtained on uniformly 13C labelled crystalline tripeptide MLF. Our data show that DQ filtered DARR experiments pave the way for obtaining through space constraints for structural studies on ligands, bound to membrane receptors, or on small fragments within large proteins.},

  abstract = {Many key aspects of control of quantum systems involve manipulating a large quantum ensemble exhibiting variation in the value of parameters characterizing the system dynamics. Developing electromagnetic pulses to produce a desired evolution in the presence of such variation is a fundamental and challenging problem in this research area. We present such robust pulse designs as an optimal control problem of a continuum of bilinear systems with a common control function. We map this control problem of infinite dimension to a problem of polynomial approximation employing tools from geometric control theory. We then adopt this new notion and develop a unified computational method for optimal pulse design using ideas from pseudospectral approximations, by which a continuous-time optimal control problem of pulse design can be discretized to a constrained optimization problem with spectral accuracy. Furthermore, this is a highly flexible and efficient numerical method that requires low order of discretization and yields inherently smooth solutions. We demonstrate this method by designing effective broadband $\pi$/2 and $\pi$ pulses with reduced rf energy and pulse duration, which show significant sensitivity enhancement at the edge of the spectrum over conventional pulses in 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy experiments.},

Studies of metallocene-catalyzed alkene polymerization at room temperature have been complicated by high rates, imprecise knowledge of the distribution of different catalyst species with time, and the high sensitivity of the catalysts to low concentrations of impurities. Application of the stopped-flow NMR method to the study of the kinetics of 1-hexene polymerization in the presence of (EBI)ZrMe[MeB(C(6)F(5))(3)] demonstrates that NMR spectroscopy provides an efficient method for direct and simultaneous measurement of substrate consumption and catalyst speciation as a function of time. Kinetic modeling of the catalyst and substrate concentration time courses reveal efficient determination of initiation, propagation, and termination rate constants. As first suggested by Collins and co-workers (Polyhedron 2005, 24, 1234-1249), a kinetic model in which Zr-HB(C(6)F(5))(3) forms rapidly upon beta-hydride elimination but reacts relatively slowly with alkene to reinitiate chain growth is supported by these data.},

We suggest that relaxation theory can be used to predict experimental lineshapes provided that the simulations properly include sources of broadening. We have found that the rotational correlation times for spin labels in different percentages of glycerol/water mixtures are best modeled by a power law treatment for the viscosity, similar to that for translational diffusion. The translational diffusion coefficients themselves also have a power law dependence on the viscosity for glycerol/water mixtures. The linewidths were linearly dependent upon both the oxygen and the spin label concentration. The hyperfine splittings of all nuclei were observed to decrease linearly with increasing spin label concentration, completely at odds with existing theory which predicts a quadratic dependence upon concentration. The linear dependence was independent of hyperfine splitting until the magnitude of the hyperfine splitting was less than the homogeneous linewidth.},

  abstract = {We present here a brief review of direct force measurements between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solutions. For almost 70 years, researchers have attempted to understand the hydrophobic effect (the low solubility of hydrophobic solutes in water) and the hydrophobic interaction or force (the unusually strong attraction of hydrophobic surfaces and groups in water). After many years of research into how hydrophobic interactions affect the thermodynamic properties of processes such as micelle formation (self-assembly) and protein folding, the results of direct force measurements between macroscopic surfaces began to appear in the 1980s. Reported ranges of the attraction between variously prepared hydrophobic surfaces in water grew from the initially reported value of 80-100 Angstrom to values as large as 3,000 Angstrom. Recent improved surface preparation techniques and the combination of surface force apparatus measurements with atomic force microscopy imaging have made it possible to explain the long-range part of this interaction (at separations {\textgreater}200 Angstrom) that is observed between certain surfaces. We tentatively conclude that only the short-range part of the attraction ({\textless}100 Angstrom) represents the true hydrophobic interaction, although a quantitative explanation for this interaction will require additional research. Although our force-measuring technique did not allow collection of reliable data at separations {\textless}10 Angstrom, it is clear that some stronger force must act in this regime if the measured interaction energy curve is to extrapolate to the measured adhesion energy as the surface separation approaches zero (i.e., as the surfaces come into molecular contact).},

The selective advantages of the organic osmolyte systems are, first, a compatibility with macromolecular structure and function at high or variable (or both) osmolyte concentrations, and, second, greatly reduced needs for modifying proteins to function in concentrated intracellular solutions. Osmolyte compatibility is proposed to result from the absence of osmolyte interactions with substrates and cofactors, and the nonperturbing or favorable effects of osmolytes on macromolecular-solvent interactions.},

Two highly conserved residues in the peptide were identified as being important for the membrane ordering effect. Aggregation of large unilamellar vesicles induced by the peptide was also found to be correlated with the membrane ordering effect of the peptide, indicating that an increase in membrane ordering, i.e., membrane dehydration, is important for vesicle aggregation. The possibility that hydrophobic interaction between the highly ordered membrane domains plays a role in vesicle aggregation and viral fusion is discussed.},

Cosolvents that shift the equilibrium toward the unfolded ensemble are termed denaturants, whereas those that favor the folded ensemble are known as protecting osmolytes. Urea is a widely used denaturant in protein folding studies, and the molecular mechanism of its action has been vigorously debated in the literature. Here we review recent experimental as well as computational studies that show an emerging consensus in this problem. Urea has been shown to denature proteins through a direct mechanism, by interacting favorably with the peptide backbone as well as the amino acid side chains. In contrast, the molecular mechanism by which the naturally occurring protecting osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) stabilizes proteins is not clear. Recent studies have established the strong interaction of TMAO with water. Detailed molecular simulations, when used with force fields that incorporate these interactions, can provide insight into this problem. We present the development of a model for TMAO that is consistent with experimental observations and that provides physical insight into the role of cosolvent-cosolvent interaction in determining its preferential interaction with proteins.},

Polyacrylamide gels, with total polymer concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 0.35 g/ml and crosslinker concentrations from 0 to 10{\%} by weight, were studied. The data showed no effect of the crosslinker concentration on the diffusion of water molecules. The Ogston-Morris and Mackie-Meares models fit the general trends observed for water diffusion in gels. The diffusion coefficients from the volume averaging method also fit the data, and this theory was able to account for the effects of water-gel interactions that are not accounted for in the other two theories. The averaging theory also did not require the physically unrealistic assumption, required in the other two theories, that the acrylamide fibers are of similar size to water molecules. Contrary to the diffusion data,T1relaxation measurements showed a significant effect of crosslinker concentration on the relaxation of water in gels. The model developed using the Bloch equations and the volume averaging method described the effects of water adsorption on the gel medium on both the diffusion coefficients and the relaxation measurements. In the proposed model the gel medium was assumed to consist of three phases (i.e., bulk water, uncrosslinked acrylamide fibers, and a bisacrylamide crosslinker phase). The effects of the crosslinker concentration were accounted for by introducing the proton partition coefficient,Keq, between the bulk water and crosslinker phase. The derived relaxation equations were successful in fitting the experimental data. The partition coefficient,Keq, decreased significantly as the crosslinker concentration increased from 5 to 10{\%} by weight. This trend is consistent with the idea that bisacrylamide tends to form hydrophobic regions with increasing crosslinker concentration.},

This technique, previously named remotely enhanced liquids for image contrast (RELIC), produces a continuous flow of hyperpolarized water and gives up to an -8.2-fold enhanced signal within the image with respect to thermally polarized signal at 2.0T. Using flow through a cylindrical expansion phantom as a model system, spin-echo intensity images with DNP are compared to 3D phase shift velocity images to illustrate the complementary information available from the two techniques. The spin-echo intensity images enhanced with DNP show that the levels of enhancement provide an estimate of the transient propagation of flow, while the phase shift velocity images quantitatively measure the velocity of each imaging voxel. Phase shift velocity images acquired with and without DNP show that DNP weights velocity values towards those of the inflowing (DNP-enhanced) water, while velocity images without DNP more accurately reflect the average steady-state velocity of each voxel. We conclude that imaging with DNP prepolarized water better captures the transient path of water shortly after injection, while phase shift velocity imaging is best for quantifying the steady-state flow of water throughout the entire phantom.},

  abstract = {The function of many proteins involves equilibria between conformational substates, and to elucidate mechanisms of function it is essential to have experimental tools to detect the presence of conformational substates and to determine the time scale of exchange between them. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) has the potential to serve this purpose. In proteins containing a nitroxide side chain (R1), multicomponent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra can arise either from equilibria involving different conformational substates or rotamers of R1. To employ SDSL to uniquely identify conformational equilibria, it is thus essential to distinguish between these origins of multicomponent spectra. Here we show that this is possible based on the time scale for exchange of the nitroxide between distinct environments that give rise to multicomponent EPR spectra; rotamer exchange for R1 lies in the {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}0.1$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}1 {\$}\mu{\$}s range, while conformational exchange is at least an order of magnitude slower. The time scales of exchange events are determined by saturation recovery EPR, and in favorable cases, the exchange rate constants between substates with lifetimes of approximately 1$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}70 {\$}\mu{\$}s can be estimated by the approach.},

Therefore, polymeric nanocontainers containing a high amount of superparamagnetic MnFe2 O4 nanoparticles and a thermo-degradable shell are fabricated via a miniemulsion route. The process allows the facile encapsulation of hydrophilic compounds, as demonstrated for a model dye. Release of the encapsulated dye is achieved upon application of an external alternating magnetic field. While the magnetic nanoparticles here act as heat generators to stimulate the decomposition of the shell and subsequently a release of the payload, they additionally enable the use of the nanocapsules as imaging agents for MRI. Due to the encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles, the nanocapsules possess high r2 relaxivity values of 96-120 Hz mmol(-1) , which makes them suitable for MRI. In toxicity experiments, the nanocapsules show no cell toxicity up to fairly high concentrations (600 µg mL(-1) ). Due to their dual-functionality, the nanocapsules possess high potential as nanocarriers with combined magnetic-field-induced release capability and as contrast agents for MRI.},

Material and Methods: Hyperpolarized Xe gas was dissolved in ethanol, a carrier agent with high solubility for Xe (Ostwald solubility coefficient 2.5) and long relaxation times. The dissolved Xe was injected as a bolus into a flow phantom where the mean flow velocity was 15 cm/s. Ultrafast EPI images with 44 ms scan time were acquired of the flowing bolus and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) were measured. Results: The relaxation times of hyperpolarized Xe in ethanol were measured to T1=160+-11 s and T2=20 s. The resulting images of the flowing liquid were of reasonable quality and had an SNR of about 70. Conclusion: Based on the SNR of the obtained Xe EPI images, it was estimated that rapid in vivo MRA with 129Xe may be feasible, provided that an efficient, biologically acceptable carrier for Xe can be found and polarization levels of more than 25{\%} can be achieved in isotopically enriched 129Xe.},

Comparing protein processes with the dielectric fluctuations of the surrounding solvent shows that they fall into two classes: nonslaved and slaved. Nonslaved processes are independent of the solvent motions; their rates are determined by the protein conformation and vibrational dynamics. Slaved processes are tightly coupled to the solvent; their rates have approximately the same temperature dependence as the rate of the solvent fluctuations, but they are smaller. Because the temperature dependence is determined by the activation enthalpy, we propose that the solvent is responsible for the activation enthalpy, whereas the protein and the hydration shell control the activation entropy through the energy landscape. Bond formation is the prototype of nonslaved processes; opening and closing of channels are quintessential slaved motions. The prevalence of slaved motions highlights the importance of the environment in cells and membranes for the function of proteins.},

The probe consists of an inner 2.5 mm "heating coil" designed for generating rf-electric fields of 190-220 MHz across a lossy dielectric sample and an outer two coil assembly for (1)H-, (2)H- and (15)N-nuclei. High B(0) field homogeneities (0.7 Hz at 600 MHz) are combined with high heating rates (20-25 K/s) and only small temperature gradients ({\textless}±1.5 K, 3s after 20 K T-jump). The heating coil is under control of a high power rf-amplifier within the NMR console and can therefore easily be accessed by the pulse programmer. Furthermore, implementation of a real-time setup including synchronization of the NMR spectrometer's air flow heater with the rf-heater used to maintain the temperature of the sample is described. Finally, the applicability of the real-time T-jump setup for the investigation of biomolecular kinetic processes in the second-to-minute timescale is demonstrated for samples of a model 14mer DNA hairpin and a (15)N-selectively labeled 40nt hsp17-RNA thermometer.},

We find that when the attractive field acts only in the solute hydration shell, but not in the solute core, it does not significantly alter water density fluctuations in the solute core region. We further find that for a wide range of solute sizes and attraction strengths, the free energetics of turning on the attractive fields in bulk water are accurately captured by linear response theory. Our results also suggest strategies for more efficiently estimating hydration free energies of realistic solutes in bulk water and at interfaces.},

  abstract = {Absorption of terahertz (THz) radiation by aqueous solutions of large solutes reports on the polarization response of their hydration shells. This is because the dipolar relaxation of the solute is dynamically frozen at these frequencies, and most of the solute-induced absorption changes, apart from the expulsion of water, are caused by interfacial water. We propose a model expressing the dipolar response of solutions in terms of a single parameter, the interface dipole moment induced in the interfacial water by electromagnetic radiation. We apply this concept to experimental THz absorption of hydrated sugars, amino acids, and proteins. None of the solutes studied here follow the expectations of dielectric theories, which predict a negative projection of the interface dipole on the external electric field. We find that this prediction is not able to describe the available experimental data, which instead suggests a nearly zero interface dipole for sugars and a more diverse pattern for amino acids. Hydrophobic amino acids, similarly to sugars, give rise to near zero interface dipoles, while strongly hydrophilic ones are best described by a positive projection of the interface dipole on the external field. The sign of the interface dipole is connected to the slope of the absorption coefficient with the solute concentration. A positive slope, implying an increase in the solution polarity relative to water, mirrors results frequently reported for protein solutions. We therefore use molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated glucose and lambda repressor protein to calculate the interface dipole moments of these solutes and the concentration dependence of the THz absorption. The absorption at THz frequencies increases with increasing solute concentration in both cases, implying a higher polarity of the solution compared to bulk water. The structure of the hydration layer, extracted from simulations, is qualitatively similar in both cases, with spatial correlations between the protein and water dipoles extending 4-5 nm into the bulk. The theory makes a testable prediction of the inversion of the positive slope at THz frequencies to a negative slope at lower frequencies of tens to hundreds of GHz.},

Functional analyses indicate Sec14p integrates phospholipid metabolism with the membrane trafficking activity of yeast Golgi membranes. In this regard, the ability of Sec14p to rapidly exchange bound phospholipid with phospholipid monomers that reside in stable membrane bilayers is considered to be important for Sec14p function in cells. How Sec14p-like proteins bind phospholipids remains unclear. Herein, we describe the application of EPR spectroscopy to probe the local dynamics and the electrostatic microenvironment of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) bound by Sec14p in a soluble protein-PtdCho complex. We demonstrate that PtdCho movement within the Sec14p binding pocket is both anisotropic and highly restricted and that the C-5 region of the sn-2 acyl chain of bound PtdCho is highly shielded from solvent, whereas the distal region of that same acyl chain is more accessible. Finally, high field EPR reports on a heterogeneous polarity profile experienced by a phospholipid bound to Sec14p. Taken together, the data suggest a headgroup-out orientation of Sec14p-bound PtdCho. The data further suggest that the Sec14p phospholipid binding pocket provides a polarity gradient that we propose is a primary thermodynamic factor that powers the ability of Sec14p to abstract a phospholipid from a membrane bilayer.},

By making use of the data obtained with IR measurements it was possible to quantitatively determine the effect of hydrogen bonding on the nitrogen hyperfine-splitting constant. On this basis it is shown that EPR spectroscopy can be used as an alternative to IR spectroscopy for the determination of the thermodynamic parameters of hydrogen bond formation with nitroxides by following the dependence of the experimental EPR nitrogen hyperfine splitting of these radicals upon changing the nature of the solvent. The experimental data obtained from both IR and EPR spectroscopy indicate that nitroxides are versatile hydrogen bond acceptors giving hydrogen bonds of strength similar to that of ethers or esters. The corresponding Abraham's beta 2H values have been determined as 0.46.},

Here we report direct experimental evidence for a genuine (isocompositional) LLT without macroscopic phase separation in an aqueous solution of glycerol. We show that liquid I transforms into liquid II by way of two types of kinetics: nucleation and growth, and spinodal decomposition. Although liquid II is metastable against crystallization, we could access both its static and dynamical properties experimentally. We find that liquids I and II differ in density, refractive index, structure, hydrogen bonding state, glass transition temperature and fragility, and that the transition between the two liquids is mainly driven by the local structuring of water rather than of glycerol, suggesting a link to a plausible LLT in pure water.},

The spectrometer allows one to perform one- and two-dimensional multifrequency pulse EPR and pulse ENDOR experiments, as well as continuous wave experiments. It is equipped with two microwave sources and four microwave channels to generate pulse sequences with different amplitudes, phases, and carrier frequencies. A microwave pulse power of up to 100 W is available. Two channels form radiofrequency pulses with adjustable phases for ENDOR experiments. The spectrometer performance is demonstrated by single crystal pulse ENDOR experiments on a copper complex. A HYSCORE experiment demonstrates that the advantages of high-field EPR and correlation spectroscopy can be combined and exploited at Q-band. Furthermore, we illustrate how this combination can be used in cases where the HYSCORE experiment is no longer effective at 35 GHz because of the shallow modulation depth. Even in cases where the echo modulation is virtually absent in the HYSCORE experiment at Q-band, matched microwave pulses allow one to get HYSCORE spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio as good as at X-band. Finally, it is shown that the high microwave power, the short pulses, and the broad resonator bandwidth make the spectrometer well suited to Fourier transform EPR experiments.},

Studies with the spin label probes 5-, 12- and 16-doxyl stearic acid (DSA) indicated that both the order parameter and the rotational correlation times increased when the doxyl group was positioned closer to the headgroup region. These findings indicate that the fluidity of membranes decreased near the headgroup region. Comparing 16-DSA incorporated in vesicle formulations with either 30 or 70 mol{\%} showed no difference in alkyl chain mobility as was reflected by the order parameter. The rotational correlation times, however, showed a slowdown from 0.38 to 0.71 and 1.13 ns when the PEG-8-L molar content was decreased from 100 to 70 and 30 mol{\%} for PEG-8-L:L-595:CS vesicles, resp. Extrusion measurements indicated an increase in elasticity of vesicle bilayers as the molar content of PEG-8-L was increased from 10 to 90 mol{\%}. Incorporation of cholesterol sulfate stabilizes vesicles and thereby, decreases the elasticity. The increased elasticity correlated excellent with a redn. in the rotational correlation times obsd. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that when the molar content of the single chain non-ionic surfactant PEG-8-L in vesicles is increased the elasticity is enhanced and the rotational correlation time is reduced. The enhanced elasticity might contribute to an optimal design of vesicles as drug carriers for transdermal application. [on SciFinder (R)]},

At temperatures near 25 K, (1)H and cross-polarized (13)C NMR signals from (15)N,(13)C-labeled L-alanine in trinitroxide-doped glycerol/water are reduced by factors as large as six compared to signals from samples without nitroxide doping. Without MAS or at temperatures near 100 K, differences between signals with and without nitroxide doping are much smaller. We attribute most of the reduction of NMR signals under MAS near 25 K to nuclear spin depolarization through the cross-effect dynamic nuclear polarization mechanism, in which three-spin flips drive nuclear polarizations toward equilibrium with spin polarization differences between electron pairs. When T1e is sufficiently long relative to the MAS rotation period, the distribution of electron spin polarization across the nitroxide electron paramagnetic resonance lineshape can be very different from the corresponding distribution in a static sample at thermal equilibrium, leading to the observed effects. We describe three-spin and 3000-spin calculations that qualitatively reproduce the experimental observations.},

abstract = {NMR spectroscopy is intrinsically insensitive, a frequently serious limitation especially in biochemical applications where sample size is limited and compounds may be too insoluble or unstable for data to be accumulated over long periods. Fourier transform (FT) NMR was developed by Ernst1 to speed up the accumulation of useful data, dramatically improving the quality of spectra obtained in a given observing time by recording the free induction decay (FID) data directly in time, at the cost of requiring numerical processing. Ernst also proposed that more information could be obtained from the spectrum if the FID was multiplied by a suitable apodizing function before being Fourier transformed. For example (see ref. 2), an increase in sensitivity can result from the use of a matched filter1, whereas an increase in resolution can be achieved by the use of gaussian multiplication1,3, application of sine bells4$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}8 or convolution difference9. These methods are now used routinely in NMR data processing. The maximum entropy method (MEM)10 is theoretically capable of achieving simultaneous enhancement in both respects11, and this has been borne out in practice in other fields where it has been applied. However, this technique requires relatively heavy computation. We describe here the first practical application of MEM to NMR, and we analyse 13C and 1H NMR spectra of 2-vinyl pyridine. Compared with conventional spectra, MEM gives considerable suppression of noise, accompanied by significant resolution enhancement. Multiplets in the 1H spectra are resolved better leading to improved visual clarity.},

The large value of 4.8 nm for the interspin distance determined between positions 107 in loop 4 and 223 in loop 7 strongly supports the idea of these positions being located on opposite sides of the membrane. Significant smaller values of between 1.8 and 2.5 nm were found for the average interspin distances between spin labels attached to the cytoplasmic loops 2 and 4 (position 37 and 107) and loops 2 and 6 (position 37 and 187). The large distance distribution widths visible in the pair correlation functions reveal a high flexibility of the studied loop regions. An increase of the distance between positions 37 and 187 upon Na+ binding suggests ligand-induced structural alterations of PutP. The results demonstrate that four-pulse double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy is a powerful means to investigate the structure and conformational changes of integral membrane proteins reconstituted in proteoliposomes.},

Here we review the relevant computational models for chaperonin function. We propose that these models need not be mutually exclusive and in fact can be thought of as a set of tools the chaperonin may use to aid in the folding of a diverse array of substrate proteins. We conclude with a discussion of the role of water in the chaperonin mechanism, a factor that until recently has been largely neglected by most computational studies of chaperonin function.},

The hydroxide conductivity ($\sigma$OH-), water uptakes, ion exchange capacity (IEC), thermal stability, mechanical property, oxidative stability and alkaline stabilities of CS/EMImC-Co-EP membranes are measured to evaluate their applicability in H2/O2 alkaline fuel cells (FC). The effects of thermal cross-linking temperature and membrane composition on membrane OH− conductivity are studied using AC impedance technique. FTIR, SEM and TG analysis are used for structural characterization of these membranes. It is found that the OH− conductivity of the membranes increases with temperature and exceeds 10−2Scm−1 at 80°C. The CS/EMImC-Co-EP membranes show excellent thermal stability with onset degradation temperature high above 200°C. In particular, the high alkaline stability is achieved for the CS/EMImC-Co-EP membranes in hot 8.0M KOH at 85°C without losing their integrity and OH− conductivity during 300hours of evaluation, and also a relatively high oxidative stability. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabricated with CS/EMImC-Co-EP (1:0.5 by mass) gives an initial power density of 21.7mWcm−2 using H2 as the fuel and O2 as oxidant at room temperature, on a low metal loading on both the anode and the cathode of 0.5mg (Pt)cm−2 at ambient temperature.},

The apolar nature of TMDs necessitates the use of membrane-mimetic solvents for many structure and folding studies. This review examines the relationship between TMD structure and solvent environment, focusing on principles elucidated largely in membrane-mimetic environments with single-TMD protein and peptide models. Following a brief description of TMD sequence and conformational characteristics gleaned from the structural database, we present an overview of the conceptual models used to study folding in vitro. The impact of sequence and solvent context on the incorporation of TMDs into membranes, and its role in measurements of TMD self-assembly strengths, is then described. We conclude with a discussion of the nonspecific effects of membrane components on TMD stability.},

Collection time profiles are quantitatively measured using fluorescence microscopy over the range 100 kHz to 5 MHz and are represented in terms of two parameters: the initial dielectrophoretic collection rate, and the initial to steady-state collection transition. Measured values for both parameters are consistent with trends in the frequency-dependent real part of the effective polarizability measured for the same plasmid DNA using dielectric spectroscopy. The experimentally measured parameters are qualitatively compared with trends predicted by theory that takes into account dielectrophoretic particle movement and diffusion. The differences between experiment and theory are discussed with suggested improvements to theoretical models, for example, including the effects of electrohydrodynamically driven fluid motion.},

Although they are intuitive and easy to implement, their development was heuristic and mainly ad hoc. Using a special form of the thresholding operation, called soft thresholding, we show that the fixed point of iterative thresholding is equivalent to minimum l(1)-norm reconstruction. We illustrate the method for spectrum analysis of a time series. This result helps to explain the success of these methods and illuminates connections with maximum entropy and minimum area methods, while also showing that there are more efficient routes to the same result. The power of the l(1)-norm and related functionals as regularizers of solutions to underdetermined systems will likely find numerous useful applications in NMR.},

The broad frequency and large dynamic range make possible structural determinations in molecular systems of increasingly larger size from measurements of heavy atom (13C, 15N, 18O) isotopes recorded in natural abundance in the same spectrum as that of the parent isotopic species. The design of a broadband spectrometer operating in the 2–8GHz frequency range with further improvements in sensitivity is presented. The current CP-FTMW spectrometer performance is benchmarked in the analyses of the rotational spectrum of the water heptamer, (H2O)7, in both 2–8GHz and 6–18GHz frequency ranges. Two isomers of the water heptamer have been observed in a pulsed supersonic molecular expansion. High level ab initio structural searches were performed to provide plausible low-energy candidates which were directly compared with accurate structures provided from broadband rotational spectra. The full substitution structure of the most stable species has been obtained through the analysis of all possible singly-substituted isotopologues (H218O and HDO), and a least-squares rm(1) geometry of the oxygen framework determined from 16 different isotopic species compares with the calculated O–O equilibrium distances at the 0.01{\AA} level.},

In this regard, surfactant chemistry plays a critical role as it facilitates the substrate-nanotube interactions. Despite its importance, detailed understanding of the subject up until now has been lacking, especially toward tuning the controllability of SWCNT assembly for thin-film transistors. Here, we explore SWCNT assembly with steroid- and alkyl-based surfactants. While steroid-based surfactants yield highly dense nanotube thin films, alkyl surfactants are found to prohibit nanotube assembly. The latter is attributed to the formation of packed alkyl layers of residual surfactants on the substrate surface, which subsequently repel surfactant encapsulated SWCNTs. In addition, temperature is found to enhance the nanotube deposition rate and density. Using this knowledge, we demonstrate highly dense and rapid assembly with an effective SWCNT surface coverage of ∼99{\%} as characterized by capacitance-voltage measurements. The scalability of the process is demonstrated through a roll-to-roll assembly of SWCNTs on plastic substrates for large-area thin-film transistors. The work presents an important process scheme for nanomanufacturing of SWCNT-based electronics.},

From the field distribution, several key physical parameters were calculated, including cavity Q, filling factor, mean microwave magnetic field at the sample, and cavity efficiency parameter Lambda. The dependence of EPR signal intensity on sample diameter for a cylindrical aqueous sample was calculated and measured experimentally for non-saturated and half-saturated samples.

The reduction in effective macromolecular tumbling is directly dependent upon the viscosity of the solvent. Liquid ethane is of sufficiently low viscosity at pressures below 5000 psi to offer a significant advantage. Unfortunately, the viscosity of liquid ethane shows appreciable pressure dependence. Reverse micelle encapsulation in liquid ethane often requires significantly higher pressures, which obviates the potential advantages offered by liquid ethane over liquid propane. Addition of co-surfactants or co-solvents can be used to manipulate the minimum pressure required to obtain stable, well-behaved solutions of reverse micelles prepared in liquid ethane. A library of potential additives is examined and several candidates suitable for use with encapsulated proteins are described.},

  abstract      = {We used high-resolution quasielastic neutron scattering spectroscopy to study the single-particle dynamics of water molecules on the surface of hydrated DNA samples. Both H(2)O and D(2)O hydrated samples were measured. The contribution of scattering from DNA is subtracted out by taking the difference of the signals between the two samples. The measurement was made at a series of temperatures from 270 down to 185 K. The relaxing-cage model was used to analyze the quasielastic spectra. This allowed us to extract a Q-independent average translational relaxation time {\textless}tau(T){\textgreater} of water molecules as a function of temperature. We observe clear evidence of a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover (FSC) at T(L)=222+/-2 K by plotting log{\textless}tau(T){\textgreater} versus T. The coincidence of the dynamic transition temperature T(c) of DNA, signaling the onset of anharmonic molecular motion, and the FSC temperature T(L) of the hydration water suggests that the change of mobility of the hydration water molecules across T(L) drives the dynamic transition in DNA.},

Here, the tip of the commercial atomic force microscope cantilever oscillates in the conventional direction, normal to the surface of the film, complementing our previous studies of dielectric fluctuations carried out using an ultrasensitive custom-fabricated cantilever oscillating parallel to the film surface. We show that frequency noise induced by mechanical vibrations can be distinguished from frequency noise resulting from thermal dielectric fluctuations by the dependence on applied voltage and tip-sample separation, allowing molecular information to be unambiguously extracted. A linear response theory for cantilever frequency noise over a molecular material correctly reproduces the observed dependences on frequency, voltage, and tip-sample separation. The technique is shown to measure primarily fluctuations in the electric field gradient over the surface, which in these measurements are generated by orientational relaxation of polar polymer segments.},

The growth of the signal enhancement is governed by the rotating frame nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time (T-1 rho), which is four orders of magnitude shorter than the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time (T-ln), Due to the rapid polarization transfer in the nuclear rotating frame the experiment can be recycled at a rate of 1/T-1 rho and is not limited by the much slower lab frame nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T-ln). The increased repetition rate allowed in the nuclear rotating frame provides an effective enhancement per unit time(1/2) of epsilon(t) = 197, The nuclear rotating frame-DNP experiment does not require high microwave power; significant signal enhancements were obtained with a low-power (20 mW) Gunn diode microwave source and no microwave resonant structure. The symmetric trityl radical used as the polarization source is water-soluble and has a narrow EPR linewidth of 10 G at 139.5 GHz making it an ideal polarization source for high-field DNP/NMR studies of biological systems.

DNP-enhanced 1H relaxation dispersion profiles were compared to reference measurements and literature data in order to prove the reliability of DNP-enhanced relaxometry data. The method was then used to investigate the paramagnetic nuclear spin relaxation of 13C in a benzene-13C6,D6 solution of nitroxide radicals. Dispersion profiles of good quality were obtained within 2h of measurement time from a comparatively small sample of 60$\mu$l. As a prospect for future applications, DNP experiments with a high-molecular weight Poly(butadiene-1,4) melt and BDPA radical were carried out at 2GHz and 9.7GHz microwave frequency, showing solid effect DNP enhancements. In-situ hyperpolarization by DNP may provide extended possibilities for FFC relaxometry, e.g. by allowing enhanced detection of dilute or insensitive nuclear spins, additional selectivity or faster measurements of small samples.},

NMR relaxation is used here to monitor the effects of high pressure on fast internal motion in the protein ubiquitin. In contrast to the main chain, the motions of the methyl-bearing side chains have a large and variable pressure dependence. Within the core, this pressure sensitivity correlates with the magnitude of motion at ambient pressure. Spatial clustering of the dynamic response to applied hydrostatic pressure is also seen, indicating localized cooperativity of motion on the sub-nanosecond time scale and suggesting regions of variable compressibility. These and other features indicate that the native ensemble contains a significant fraction of members with characteristics ascribed to the recently postulated "dry molten globule". The accompanying variable side-chain conformational entropy helps complete our view of the thermodynamic architecture underlying protein stability, folding, and function.},

  abstract = {Phonocardiograms (PCGs), recordings of heart sounds, have many advantages over traditional auscultation in that they may be replayed and analysed for spectral and frequency information. PCG is not a widely used diagnostic tool as it could be. One of the major problems with PCG is noise corruption. Many sources of noise may pollute a PCG including foetal breath sounds if the subject is pregnant, lung and breath sounds, environmental noise and noise from contact between the recording device and the skin. An electronic stethoscope is used to record heart sounds and the problem of extracting noise from the signal is addressed via the use of wavelets and averaging. Using the discrete wavelet transform, the signal is decomposed. Due to the efficient decomposition of heart signals, their wavelet coefficients tend to be much larger than those due to noise. Thus, coefficients below a certain level are regarded as noise and are thresholded out. The signal can then be reconstructed without significant loss of information in the signal content. The questions that this study attempts to answer are which wavelet families, levels of decomposition, and thresholding techniques best remove the noise in a PCG. The use of averaging in combination with wavelet denoising is also addressed. Possible applications of the Hilbert transform to heart sound analysis are discussed.},

Probing the nature of such species has, however, proved to be extremely challenging to conventional techniques because of their transient and heterogeneous character. We describe here the application of a two-color single-molecule fluorescence technique to examine the assembly of oligomeric species formed during the aggregation of the SH3 domain of PI3 kinase. The single-molecule experiments show that the species formed at the stage of the reaction where aggregates have previously been found to be maximally cytotoxic are a heterogeneous ensemble of oligomers with a median size of 38 +/- 10 molecules. This number is remarkably similar to estimates from bulk measurements of the critical size of species observed to seed ordered fibril formation and of the most infective form of prion particles. Moreover, although the size distribution of the SH3 oligomers remains virtually constant as the time of aggregation increases, their stability increases substantially. These findings together provide direct evidence for a general mechanism of amyloid aggregation in which the stable cross-beta structure emerges via internal reorganization of disordered oligomers formed during the lag phase of the self-assembly reaction.},

We present here the use of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) technique for this processing and compare this method with the other approaches currently used in the literature.

Protein transport experiments performed with isolated pea thylakoids show that the 16/33 chimera is transported in a strictly Tat-dependent manner into the thylakoid vesicles yielding mature OEC33 (mOEC33) in two different topologies. One fraction accumulates in the thylakoid lumen and is thus resistant to externally added protease. A second fraction is arrested during transport in an N-in/C-out topology within the membrane. Chase experiments demonstrate that this membrane-arrested mOEC33 moiety does not represent a translocation intermediate but instead an alternative end product of the transport process. Transport arrest of mOEC33, which is embedded in the membrane with a mildly hydrophobic protein segment, requires more than 26 additional and predominantly hydrophilic residues C-terminal of the membrane-embedded segment. Furthermore, it is stimulated by mutations which potentially affect the conformation of mOEC33 suggesting that at least partial folding of the passenger protein is required for complete membrane translocation.},

abstract = {We used the membrane-impermeable nitroxyl radical 4-trimethylammonium-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyliodide (CAT-1) as a model drug encapsulated in liposomes in order to separately map the 2D distribution of both liposomal-encapsulated CAT-1 and free CAT-1. Phantoms were prepared with a CAT-1 solution and a liposomal CAT-1 suspension. Spectral-spatial images were obtained along several polar-arranged spatial axes through the phantom. The 1D spatial distributions (projections) of each signal component, reflecting the concentration of CAT-1, were then extracted from the spectral-spatial images. 2D EPR images of liposomal-encapsulated CAT-1 and free CAT-1 were separately reconstructed from the resulting projection data sets. 2D mapping of each component exhibited good agreement with respect to the phantom. Separate maps were generated from separate injections of free CAT-1 and liposomal CAT-1 injected into the femoral muscle of a living mouse. The EPR signal of the free CAT-1 gradually decreased during data acquisition. Because of this decay, we calibrated the image intensity by extrapolating the signal intensity to that detected at the beginning of data sampling. Both the position and size of the individual images were in very good agreement with those of the mouse thigh obtained by MRI.},

abstract = {Water-soluble spin labels were used to study dimyristoyllecithin (DML) phospholipid multilayers. Previous studies report that there is a "bound" water region associated with dimyristoyllecithin containing about 10 molecules of water per phospholipid, a "trapped" water region located between the lamellae containing approximately 11 molecules per phospholipid, and a "ftion show that certain water-soluble spin-label mol-cules have their motional properties differentially modified by these three water environements. Furthermore, the labels also reveal the onset of lipid-phase transitions even though they have high water solubility. A phosphate-containing spin label demonstrated strong an isotropic motion in the lipid-water system above the phase transition but not below. The addition of cholesterol to the DML-water system removed the anisotropic motion of 2,2,6,6-tetramehtyl-4-phosphopiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempophosphate) and obscured the detection bound, trapped, and free water. In addition to the change-charge interactions between Tempophosphate and DML, two other spin labels were used both in the charged and uncharged states. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempamine) in the charged state showed extremely strong anisotropic motion, presumably due to the interaction between the charged amine and the phosphate group of DML. When only partially charged, Tempamine showed much less anisotropic motion. PCA was analyzed at pH values where the carboxyl group was protonated and unprotonated. The resulting interaction was different at the two pH values. These water-soluble spin labels mimic ionic or nonionic solutes. Upon freezing, the spin labels are shown to be expelled from the ice regions into the remaining aqueous regions. The usefulness of this approach in studying solute behavior when freezing occurs and potential studies involving aqueous regions of cytoplasm are considered.},

One reason for such subdiffusive behavior is attractive interactions between the diffusing particles that lead to temporary complex formation. Here, we show that such transient binding is not an average state of the particles but that intervals of free diffusion alternate with slower displacement when bound to neighboring particles. The observed macroscopic behavior is then the weighted average of these two contributions. Interestingly, even at very high concentrations, the unbound fraction still exhibits essentially normal diffusion.},

  abstract = {In site-directed spin labeling, the relative solvent accessibility of spin-labeled side chains is taken to be proportional to the Heisenberg exchange rate (W(ex)) of the nitroxide with a paramagnetic reagent in solution. In turn, relative values of W(ex) are determined by continuous wave power saturation methods and expressed as a proportional and dimensionless parameter Pi. In the experiments presented here, NiEDDA is characterized as a paramagnetic reagent for solvent accessibility studies, and it is shown that absolute values of W(ex) can be determined from Pi, and that the proportionality constant relating them is independent of the paramagnetic reagent and mobility of the nitroxide. Based on absolute exchange rates, an accessibility factor is defined (0 {\textless} rho {\textless} 1) that serves as a quantitative measure of side-chain solvent accessibility. The accessibility factors for a nitroxide side chain at 14 different sites in T4 lysozyme are shown to correlate with a structure-based accessibility parameter derived from the crystal structure of the protein. These results provide a useful means for relating crystallographic and site-directed spin labeling data, and hence comparing crystal and solution structures.},

The study focuses on different aspects of the density and orientational fluctuations of hydration water and the ability to separate them experimentally by combining depolarized light scattering with dielectric spectroscopy. We show that the dynamics of the density fluctuations of the hydration shells reflect the coupled dynamics of the solute and solvent and do not require a special distinction as “biological water.” The orientations of shell water molecules carry dramatically different physics and do require a separation into a sub-ensemble. Depending on the property considered, the perturbation of water{\&}apos;s orientational structure induced by the protein propagates 3–5 hydration shells into the bulk at normal temperature.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that adiabatic and fast passage ultra-wideband (UWB) pulses can achieve inversion over several hundreds of MHz and thus enhance the measurement sensitivity, as shown by two selected experiments. Technically, frequency-swept pulses are generated by a 12 GS/s arbitrary waveform generator and upconverted to X-band frequencies. This pulsed UWB source is utilized as an incoherent channel in an ordinary pulsed EPR spectrometer. We discuss experimental methodologies and modeling techniques to account for the response of the resonator, which can strongly limit the excitation bandwidth of the entire non-linear excitation chain. Aided by these procedures, pulses compensated for bandwidth or variations in group delay reveal enhanced inversion efficiency. The degree of bandwidth compensation is shown to depend critically on the time available for excitation. As a result, we demonstrate optimized inversion recovery and double electron electron resonance (DEER) experiments. First, virtually complete inversion of the nitroxide spectrum with an adiabatic pulse of 128 ns length is achieved. Consequently, spectral diffusion between inverted and non-inverted spins is largely suppressed and the observation bandwidth can be increased to increase measurement sensitivity. Second, DEER is performed on a terpyridine-based copper (II) complex with a nitroxide-copper distance of 2.5 nm. As previously demonstrated on this complex, when pumping copper spins and observing nitroxide spins, the modulation depth is severely limited by the excitation bandwidth of the pump pulse. By using fast passage UWB pulses with a maximum length of 64 ns, we achieve up to threefold enhancement of the modulation depth. Associated artifacts in distance distributions when increasing the bandwidth of the pump pulse are shown to be small. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications.},

  abstract = {At low temperature (below its freezing/melting temperature), liquid water under confinement is known to exhibit anomalous dynamical features. Here we study structure and dynamics of water in the grooves of a long DNA duplex using molecular dynamics simulations with TIP5P potential at low temperature. We find signatures of a dynamical transition in both translational and orientational dynamics of water molecules in both the major and the minor grooves of a DNA duplex. The transition occurs at a slightly higher temperature (T(GL) approximately 255 K) than the temperature at which the bulk water is found to undergo a dynamical transition, which for the TIP5P potential is at 247 K. Groove water, however, exhibits markedly different temperature dependence of its properties from the bulk. Entropy calculations reveal that the minor groove water is ordered even at room temperature, and the transition at T approximately 255 K can be characterized as a strong-to-strong dynamical transition. Confinement of water in the grooves of DNA favors the formation of a low density four-coordinated state (as a consequence of enthalpy-entropy balance) that makes the liquid-liquid transition stronger. The low temperature water is characterized by pronounced tetrahedral order, as manifested in the sharp rise near 109 degrees in the O-O-O angle distribution. We find that the Adams-Gibbs relation between configurational entropy and translational diffusion holds quite well when the two quantities are plotted together in a master plot for different region of aqueous DNA duplex (bulk, major, and minor grooves) at different temperatures. The activation energy for the transfer of water molecules between different regions of DNA is found to be weakly dependent on temperature.},

The lateral diffusion, D of CSL in DMPC/POPC/cholesterol ternary mixtures, is measured utilizing an improved dynamic imaging electron spin resonance method. It shows a factor of two decrease at 10 mol {\%} and 25 degrees C, whereas it shows only a 40{\%} decrease at 50 mol {\%} and 50 degrees C. A comparison with results in POPC/cholesterol mixtures, which show a stronger effect of cholesterol on D, indicates that acyl chain unsaturation leads to stronger self association of cholesterol in PC model membranes. An S2CSL dependence of the activation energy for D, has been confirmed for the DMPC/POPC/cholesterol mixtures. Here SCSL is the order parameter for CSL. A similar correlation of R perpendicular, the perpendicular component of the rotational diffusion coefficient, with SCSL, which is true for all three mixtures (DMPC/cholesterol, POPC/cholesterol, and DMPC/POPC/cholesterol) we have studied, is also found. These are associated with the effects of enhanced local ordering on the free volume needed for translation and reorientation. Such correlations of dynamic properties D and R perpendicular with the thermodynamic quantity S, as well as the consistent interpretations of the effect of acyl chain unsaturation on the dynamics in terms of the activity coefficients, strongly emphasize the interrelation between the dynamic structure and the thermodynamics of the PC/cholesterol mixtures.},

  abstract = {The molecular structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the translocation of model particles have been studied with a molecular theory that accounts for the geometry of the pore and the sequence and anchoring position of the unfolded domains of the nucleoporin proteins (the FG-Nups), which control selective transport through the pore. The theory explicitly models the electrostatic, hydrophobic, steric, conformational, and acid-base properties of the FG-Nups. The electrostatic potential within the pore, which arises from the specific charge distribution of the FG-Nups, is predicted to be negative close to pore walls and positive along the pore axis. The positive electrostatic potential facilitates the translocation of negatively charged particles, and the free energy barrier for translocation decreases for increasing particle hydrophobicity. These results agree with the experimental observation that transport receptors that form complexes with hydrophilic/neutral or positively charged proteins to transport them through the NPC are both hydrophobic and strongly negatively charged. The molecular theory shows that the effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the translocating potential are cooperative and nonequivalent due to the interaction-dependent reorganization of the FG-Nups in the presence of the translocating particle. The combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions can give rise to complex translocation potentials displaying a combination of wells and barriers, in contrast to the simple barrier potential observed for a hydrophilic/neutral translocating particle. This work demonstrates the importance of explicitly considering the amino acid sequence and hydrophobic, electrostatic, and steric interactions in understanding the translocation through the NPC.},

We find that Gi$\alpha$CT and Gs$\alpha$CT exploit distinct cytoplasmic receptor conformations that coexist in the uncomplexed $\beta$2AR*. The slim Gi$\alpha$CT stabilizes a $\beta$2AR* conformation, not accessible to the bulkier Gs$\alpha$CT, which requires a larger TM6 outward tilt for binding.

  abstract = {Protein folding is a spontaneous process that is essential for life, yet the concentrated and complex interior of a cell is an inherently hostile environment for the efficient folding of many proteins. Some proteins-constrained by sequence, topology, size, and function-simply cannot fold by themselves and are instead prone to misfolding and aggregation. This problem is so deeply entrenched that a specialized family of proteins, known as molecular chaperones, evolved to assist in protein folding. Here we examine one essential class of molecular chaperones, the large, oligomeric, and energy utilizing chaperonins or Hsp60s. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL, along with its co-chaperonin GroES, is probably the best-studied example of this family of protein-folding machine. In this review, we examine some of the general properties of proteins that do not fold well in the absence of GroEL and then consider how folding of these proteins is enhanced by GroEL and GroES. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that chaperonins like GroEL and GroES employ a combination of protein isolation, unfolding, and conformational restriction to drive protein folding under conditions where it is otherwise not possible.},

  abstract = {Identifying equilibrium conformational exchange and characterizing conformational substates is essential for elucidating mechanisms of function in proteins. Site-directed spin labeling has previously been employed to detect conformational changes triggered by some event, but verifying conformational exchange at equilibrium is more challenging. Conformational exchange (microsecond-millisecond) is slow on the EPR time scale, and this proves to be an advantage in directly revealing the presence of multiple substates as distinguishable components in the EPR spectrum, allowing the direct determination of equilibrium constants and free energy differences. However, rotameric exchange of the spin label side chain can also give rise to multiple components in the EPR spectrum. Using spin-labeled mutants of T4 lysozyme, it is shown that high-pressure EPR can be used to: (i) demonstrate equilibrium between spectrally resolved states, (ii) aid in distinguishing conformational from rotameric exchange as the origin of the resolved states, and (iii) determine the relative partial molar volume ($\Delta$V°) and isothermal compressibility ($\Delta$$\beta$(T)) of conformational substates in two-component equilibria from the pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant. These volumetric properties provide insight into the structure of the substates. Finally, the pressure dependence of internal side-chain motion is interpreted in terms of volume fluctuations on the nanosecond time scale, the magnitude of which may reflect local backbone flexibility.},

Analysis of electron spin dipolar interactions between pairs of nitroxides yields the inter-nitroxide distance, which provides quantitative structural information. The development of pulse EPR methods has enabled such distance measurements up to 70 A in bio-molecules, thus opening up the possibility of SDSL global structural mapping. This study evaluates SDSL distance measurement using a nitroxide (designated as R5) that can be attached, in an efficient and cost-effective manner, to a phosphorothioate backbone position at arbitrary DNA or RNA sequences. R5 pairs were attached to selected positions of a dodecamer DNA duplex with a known NMR structure, and eight distances, ranging from 20 to 40 A, were measured using double electron-electron resonance (DEER). The measured distances correlated strongly (R2 = 0.98) with the predicted values calculated based on a search of sterically allowable R5 conformations in the NMR structure, thus demonstrating accurate distance measurements using R5. Furthermore, distance measurement in a 42 kD DNA was demonstrated. The results establish R5 as a sequence-independent probe for global structural mapping of DNA and DNA-protein complexes.},

Although high-aspect-ratio resonator cavities have been produced in silicon, they suffer from unwanted multiple beam effects. However, this problem can be avoided by using the reduced symmetry of single-crystal sapphire in which x-ray cavities may produce a highly monochromatic transmitted x-ray beam. In this study, we performed nominal 100??m deep etching and vertical sidewall profiles in single crystal sapphire using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. The large depth is required to intercept a useful fraction of a stopped-down x-ray beam, as well as for beam clearance. An electroplated Ni hard mask was patterned using KMPR 1050 photoresist and contact lithography. The quality and performance of the x-ray cavity depended upon the uniformity of the cavity gap and therefore verticality of the fabricated vertical sidewall. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such deep, vertical etching of single-crystal sapphire. A gas mixture of Cl2/BCl3/Ar was used to etch the sapphire with process variables including BCl3 flow ratio and bias power. By etching for 540?min under optimal conditions, we obtained an x-ray resonant cavity with a depth of 95??m, width of {\~{}}30??m, gap of {\~{}}115??m and sidewall profile internal angle of 89.5?.

The heterogeneity characteristic of the lysozyme refolding process is preserved under crowded conditions. This, together with the observation that the refolding intermediates that accumulate to significant levels are very similar in the absence and presence of Ficoll, suggests that crowding does not alter substantially the energetics of the protein folding reaction. However, the presence of high concentrations of macromolecules results in the acceleration of the fast track of the refolding process whereas the slow track is substantially retarded. The results can be explained by preferential excluded volume stabilization of compact states relative to more unfolded states, and suggest that, relative to dilute solutions, the rates of many protein folding processes are likely to be altered under conditions that more closely resemble the intracellular environment.},

We find that the reorientation dynamics of water molecules in the hydration shell of the hydrophobic groups of TMU is between 3 (at low concentrations) and 10 (at higher concentrations) times slower than the dynamics of bulk water. The data indicate that the effect of hydrophobic groups on water is strong but relatively short-ranged. With increasing temperature, the fraction of water contained in the hydrophobic hydration shell decreases, which implies that the overall effect of hydrophobic groups on water becomes smaller.},

The technique has been used to study copper complexes, hemes, enzyme mechanisms, micellar water content, and water permeation profiles in membranes, among other applications. In the present study, we combine ESEEM spectroscopy with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and X-ray crystallography in order to evaluate the technique's potential as a structural tool to describe the native environment of membrane proteins. Using the KcsA potassium channel as a model system, we demonstrate that deuterium ESEEM can detect water permeation along the lipid-exposed surface of the KcsA outer helix. We further demonstrate that (31)P ESEEM is able to identify channel residues that interact with the phosphate headgroup of the lipid bilayer. In combination with X-ray crystallography, the (31)P data may be used to define the phosphate interaction surface of the protein. The results presented here establish ESEEM as a highly informative technique for SDSL studies of membrane proteins.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel picture of the rotation mechanism of F(1)-ATPase, a rotary-motor protein complex. Entropy, which originates from the translational displacement of water molecules, is treated as the key factor in the proposal. We calculate the water entropy gains upon formation of the $\alpha$-$\beta$, $\alpha$-$\gamma$, and $\beta$-$\gamma$ subunit pairs. The gain is given as the difference between the hydration entropy of a subunit pair and the sum of the hydration entropies of the separate subunits forming the pair. The calculation is made using a hybrid of a statistical-mechanical theory for molecular liquids and morphometric approach. The water entropy gain is considered as a measure of tightness of the packing at each subunit interface. The results are highly correlated with the numbers of stable contacts at the subunit interfaces estimated by a molecular dynamics simulation. We also calculate the hydration entropies of three different subcomplexes comprising the $\gamma$ subunit, one of the $\beta$ subunits, and two $\alpha$ subunits adjacent to them. The major finding is that the packing in F(1)-ATPase is highly asymmetrical, and this asymmetry is ascribed to the water entropy effect. We discuss how the rotation of the $\gamma$ subunit is induced by such chemical processes as ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and release of the products. In our picture, the asymmetrical packing plays crucially important roles, and the rotation is driven by the water entropy effect.},

DNP enhancement was measured at 14.529 mT, using a custom-built scanner operating in a field-cycled mode, for different concentrations, ESR irradiation times and RF power levels. DNP enhancements increased with agent concentration up to 2.5 mM and decreased above 3 mM, in tune with ESR line broadening measured at X-band as a function of the agent concentration. The proton spin-lattice relaxation times (T-1) measured at very low Zeeman field (14.529 mT) and the longitudinal relaxivity parameters were estimated. The relaxivity parameters were in good agreement with those independently computed from the linear region of the concentration dependent enhancement. The leakage factor showed an asymptotic increase with increasing agent concentration. The coupling parameters of N-14- and N-15-labeled carbamoyl-PROXYL showed the interaction between the electron and nuclear spins to be mainly dipolar in origin. Upon H-2 labeling, about 70{\%} and 40{\%} increases in enhancement for N-15- and N-14-labeled nitroxyl agents were observed, respectively. It is envisaged that the results reported here may enable better understanding of the factors determining DNP enhancement to design suitable 'beacons' for simultaneous molecular imaging by OMRI.

Terahertz spectroscopy enables the investigation of water dynamics, owing to its sensitivity to dielectric relaxation processes associated with water reorientation. By controlling the number of water molecules per lipid molecule in the system, we elucidate how the interplay between the model membrane and water molecules results in different water dynamics. For decreasing hydration levels, we observe the appearance of new types of water dynamics: the collective bulklike dynamics become less pronounced, whereas an increased amount of both very slowly reorienting (i.e., irrotational) and very rapidly reorienting (i.e., fast) water molecules appear. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal the interconversion between the three distinct types of water present in the system.},

Temperature-dependent two-dimensional infrared (2D IR), pump-probe, and linear absorption measurements are self-consistently analyzed with a response function formalism that includes the effects of spectral diffusion, population lifetime, reorientational motion, and nonequilibrium heating of the local environment upon vibrational relaxation. Over the range 278-345 K, we find the time scales of spectral diffusion and reorientational relaxation decrease from approximately 2.4 to 0.7 ps and 4.6 to 1.2 ps, respectively, which corresponds to barrier heights of 3.4 and 3.7 kcal/mol, respectively. We compare the temperature dependence of the time scales to a number of measures of structural relaxation and find similar effective activation barrier heights and slightly non-Arrhenius behavior, which suggests that the reaction coordinate for the hydrogen bond rearrangement in water is collective. Frequency and orientational correlation functions computed from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over the same temperature range support our interpretations. Finally, we find the lifetime of the OD stretch is nearly the same from 278 K to room temperature and then increases as the temperature is increased to 345 K.},

Here we describe the linear epitopes of A1, A69, and B1 which reside in VP1, VP2, and VP3, respectively, using gene fragment phage display library, peptide scan, and peptide competition experiments. In addition, MAbs A20, C24-B, C37-B, and D3 directed against conformational epitopes on AAV-2 capsids were characterized. Epitope sequences on the capsid surface were identified by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay using AAV-2 mutants and AAV serotypes, peptide scan, and peptide competition experiments. A20 neutralizes infection following receptor attachment by binding an epitope formed during AAV-2 capsid assembly. The newly isolated antibodies C24-B and C37-B inhibit AAV-2 binding to cells, probably by recognizing a loop region involved in binding of AAV-2 to the cellular receptor. In contrast, binding of D3 to a loop near the predicted threefold spike does not neutralize AAV-2 infection. The identified antigenic regions on the AAV-2 capsid surface are discussed with respect to their possible roles in different steps of the viral life cycle.},

abstract = {Phage display technology has been used in a variety of contexts to understand and manipulate biomolecular interactions between proteins and other biomolecules. In this paper we describe the establishment of a phage display system for elucidation of the interactions between the GTPase Ras and its panel of effectors. It is shown how technical problems associated with phage display of a protein with unpaired cysteines, likely to be caused by the oxidizing environment of the bacterial periplasm into which the protein is directed, can be overcome by cysteine replacement based on functional and structural studies. First, the catalytic domain (residues 1-166) of mammalian H-Ras (Ras) was observed to be displayed on phage in an incorrect conformation not detectable by antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes on Ras. Although truncation of the phage coat protein used as fusion partner (g3p) resulted in minor improvements in the display, Ras was tailored for phage display by cysteine replacement. By replacing the three cysteines at positions 51, 80 and 118 of Ras with the corresponding residues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAS1, the resulting fusion-phage is recognized by the conformation-dependent anti-Ras antibodies. Furthermore, display of cysteine-free Ras is demonstrated by GTP-analogue dependent binding to the Ras-binding domain of the Ras-effector Raf1. These data pave the way for analysis of Ras-effector interactions using phage display technology yet demonstrate that phage display of proteins with normally reduced cysteines should be approached with caution.},

  abstract  = {The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules fluctuate over a wide range of time-scales. Separating the individual dynamic processes according to frequency is of importance in relating protein motions to biological function and stability. We present here a general NMR method for the specific characterization of microsecond motions at backbone positions in proteins even in the presence of other dynamics such as large-amplitude nanosecond motions and millisecond chemical exchange processes. The method is based on measurement of relaxation rates of four bilinear coherences and relies on the ability of strong continuous radio frequency fields to quench millisecond chemical exchange. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated and validated through two specific examples focusing on the thermo-stable proteins, ubiquitin and protein L, where it is found that small-amplitude microsecond dynamics are more pervasive than previously thought. Specifically, these motions are localized to alpha helices, loop regions, and regions along the rim of beta sheets in both of the proteins examined. A third example focuses on a 28 kDa ternary complex of the chaperone Chz1 and the histones H2A.Z/H2B, where it is established that pervasive microsecond motions are localized to a region of the chaperone that is important for stabilizing the complex. It is further shown that these motions can be well separated from extensive millisecond dynamics that are also present and that derive from exchange of Chz1 between bound and free states. The methodology is straightforward to implement, and data recorded at only a single static magnetic field are required.},

abstract = {Comparative analysis of the photoelectric response of dried films of purple membranes (PM) depending on their degree of orientation is presented. Time dependence of the photo-induced protein electric response signal (PERS) of oriented and non-oriented films to a single laser pulse in the presence of the external electric field (EEF) was experimentally determined. The signal does not appear in the non-oriented films when the EEF is absent, whereas the PERS of the oriented PM films demonstrates the variable polarity on the microsecond time scale. In the presence of the EEF the PERS of the non-oriented film rises exponentially preserving the same polarization. The polarization of the PERS changes by changing the polarity of the EEF with no influence on the time constant of the PERS kinetics. The EEF effect on the PERS of the oriented films is more complicated. By subtracting the PERS when EEF not equal 0 from the PERS when EEF = 0 the resulting signal is comparable to that of the non-oriented films. Generalizing the experimental data we conclude that the EEF influence is of the same origin for the films of any orientation. To explain the experimental results the two-state model is suggested. It assumes that the EEF directionally changes the pK(a) values of the Schiff base (SB) and of the proton acceptor aspartic acid D85 in bacteriorhodopsin. Because of that the SB--{\textgreater}D85 proton transfer might be blocked and consequently the L--{\textgreater}M intermediate transition should vanish. Thus, on the characteristic time scale tau( L --{\textgreater} M ) approximately 30 micros; both intermediates, the M intermediate, appearing under normal conditions, and the L intermediate as persisting under the blocked conditions when D85 is protonated, should coexist in the film. The total PERS is a result of the potentials corresponding to the electrogenic products of intermediates L and M that are of the opposite polarity. It is concluded that the ratio of bacteriorhodopsin concentrations corresponding to the L and M intermediates is driven by the EEF and, consequently, it should define the PERS of the non-oriented films. According to this model the orientation degree of the film could be evaluated by describing the PERS.},

Initially, the aqueous solution, held at 40 °C, consists of Pluronic P123 micelles, which are characterized by a hydrophilic corona, comprising the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) blocks, and a hydrophobic core, consisting of the poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) block. The variations in the volume of the hydrophobic core of the micelles as a consequence of the addition of the silica source (TEOS, tetraethoxyorthosilane) were evaluated using a hydrophobic spin-probe, 4-hydroxy-tempobenzoate (4HTB), which is localized in the hydrophobic core of the micelles. The measurements were carried out on solutions that were freeze?quenched at different times after the addition of TEOS (tetraethoxyorthosilane). New details on the formation of KIT-6 were obtained, revealing swelling of the hydrophobic core during the first ?10 min of the reaction followed by a contraction, close to the original size. The swelling was attributed to penetration of the TEOS and its hydrolysis products into the micelles. Double electron?electron resonance (DEER) is employed to explore the evolution of solution structures during the formation of the bicontinuous cubic (Ia3?d) mesoporous material KIT-6.

Membrane structural changes upon antigen cross-linking of IgE receptors (IgE-Fc$\epsilon$RI) in plasma membrane vesicles (PMVs) isolated from RBL-2H3 mast cells are investigated, for the first time, by means of these 2D-ELDOR techniques. Spectra of 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidylcholine (16-PC) from PMVs before and after this stimulation at several temperatures are reported. The results demonstrate a coexistence of liquid-ordered (L(o)) and liquid-disordered (L(d)) components. We find that upon cross-linking, the membrane environment is remodeled to become more disordered, as shown by a moderate increase in the population of the L(d) component. This change in the relative amount of the L(o) versus L(d) components upon cross-linking is consistent with a model wherein the IgE receptors, which when clustered by antigen to cause cell stimulation, lead to more disordered lipids, and their dynamic and structural properties are slightly altered. This study demonstrates that 2D-ELDOR, analyzed by the full Sc- method, is a powerful approach for capturing the molecular dynamics in biological membranes. This is a particular case showing how 2D-ELDOR can be applied to study physical processes in complex systems that yield subtle changes.},

Here we solved the high-resolution solution structure of the 15.4 kDa homodimer CylR2, the regulator of cytolysin production from Enterococcus faecalis, which deviates by 1.1 angstroms from the previously determined X-ray structure. We studied the influence of different experimental information such as long-range distances derived from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, residual dipolar couplings, symmetry restraints and intermonomer Nuclear Overhauser Effect restraints on the accuracy of the derived structure. In addition, we show that it is useful to combine experimental information with methods of ab initio docking when the available experimental data are not sufficient to obtain convergence to the correct homodimeric structure. In particular, intermonomer distances may not be required when residual dipolar couplings are compared to values predicted on the basis of the charge distribution and the shape of ab initio docking solutions.},

A new stimulating effect of the field on the BR412 intermediate accumulation in the normal photochromic cycle of BR570 has been observed. The formation of the product BR412 is supposed to be accompanied by specific rearrangements of certain charged, polar and polarizable groups in the BR pigment-protein matrix. Such an intrinsic polarization could be promoted by an external electric field, the displacement vector of those groups being oriented in the direction of the filed. The dielectric polarization properties of the purple membranes have been demonstrated by electret-thermal analysis.},

However, recent data from the laboratory and the clinic have renewed our hope for the development of RAS-inhibitory molecules. In this Review, we summarize the progress and the promise of five key approaches. Firstly, we focus on the prospects of using direct inhibitors of RAS. Secondly, we address the issue of whether blocking RAS membrane association is a viable approach. Thirdly, we assess the status of targeting RAS downstream effector signalling, which is arguably the most favourable current approach. Fourthly, we address whether the search for synthetic lethal interactors of mutant RAS still holds promise. Finally, RAS-mediated changes in cell metabolism have recently been described and we discuss whether these changes could be exploited for new therapeutic directions. We conclude with perspectives on how additional complexities, which are not yet fully understood, may affect each of these approaches.},

In particular, this is critical for proteins in ionic buffers. Rf sample heating increases proportional to frequency which may result in the need to reduce the rf pulse power to prevent partial or total sample deterioration. In the present paper, we propose a multifrequency-tunable NMR resonator where the sample is electrically shielded from the NMR coil by a conductive sheet that increases the magneto-electric ratio. Expressions for the B1 efficiency as function of magnetic and electric filling factors are derived that allow a direct comparison of different resonators. Rf efficiency, homogeneity, signal-to-noise, and rf sample heating are compared. NMR spectra at 700MHz on ethylene glycol, glycine, and a model protein were acquired to compare the resonators under realistic experimental conditions.},

Temperature- and humidity-dependent changes in the membrane system influence the accessibility of the different photocycle intermediates of BR. The melting of the 'freezing bound water' between 220 and 250 K could be related to the transition from the M1 to the M2 intermediate, which represents the key step in the photocycle. The dynamic transition in the vicinity of 180 K was shown to be necessary to ensure that the M1 intermediate can be populated and that the melting of crystallized bulk water above 255 K enables the completion of the photocycle.},

XPA serves as a scaffold for NER, interacting with several other NER proteins as well as the DNA substrate. The critical importance of XPA is underscored by its association with the most severe clinical phenotypes of the genetic disorder Xeroderma pigmentosum. Many of these disease-associated mutations map to the XPA98-219 DNA-binding domain (DBD) first reported ∼20 years ago. Although multiple solution NMR structures of XPA98-219 have been determined, the molecular basis for the interaction of this domain with DNA is only poorly characterized. In this report, we demonstrate using a fluorescence anisotropy DNA-binding assay that the previously reported XPA DBD binds DNA with substantially weaker affinity than the full-length protein. In-depth analysis of the XPA sequence suggested that the original DBD construct lacks critical basic charge and helical elements at its C-terminus. Generation and analysis of a series of C-terminal extensions beyond residue 219 yielded a stable, soluble human XPA98-239 construct that binds to a Y-shaped ssDNA-dsDNA junction and other substrates with the same affinity as the full-length protein. Two-dimensional (15)N-(1)H NMR suggested XPA98-239 contains the same globular core as XPA98-219 and likely undergoes a conformational change upon binding DNA. Together, our results demonstrate that the XPA DBD should be redefined and that XPA98-239 is a suitable model to examine the DNA binding activity of human XPA.},

  abstract = {Nuclear modulation in electron‐spin‐echo spectroscopy is conventionally studied by one‐dimensional electron‐spin‐echo envelope modulation (1D‐ESEEM). Two‐dimensional Fourier transform electron‐spin resonance (2D‐FTESR) studies of nuclear modulation have the promise of enhancing the spectral resolution and clarifying the key details of the relaxation processes. We present a 2D‐FTESR study on single proton nuclear modulation from $\gamma$‐irradiated malonic acidsingle crystals to test the validity of the Gamliel–Freed theory and to assess the value of the new methods. The two pulse spin‐echo correlation spectroscopy (SECSY) spectra as a function of orientation of the single crystal show very good agreement with the Gamliel–Freed theory extended to the general case of nonaxially symmetric hyperfine interaction. It is very simply affected by spin relaxation, such that relative intensities are essentially unaffected. Thus SECSY‐ESR can most reliably be utilized for studying nuclear modulation. Stimulated SECSY provides the simplest nuclear modulation patterns, which, however, do exhibit the suppression effect well known in three‐pulse ESEEM studies. Two‐dimensional electron–electron double resonance (2D‐ELDOR) provides nuclear modulation patterns similar to that of SECSY‐ESR, so the suppression effect is absent. Both three‐pulse methods exhibit complex relaxation behavior which can affect relative intensities. This is a feature characteristic of three‐pulse ESEEM, but is not well understood. It is shown how the 2D‐FTESR methods enable one to obtain the details of the complex spin relaxation, and in the process, obtain very good agreement between experiment and theory. 2D‐ELDOR exhibits exchange cross peaks as well as coherence peaks from the nuclear modulation. It is shown how experiments, as a function of mixing time, enable one to separate the effects of the two. It is pointed out that such experiments are in the spirit of 3D spectroscopy. A new observation of the broadening of the 2D‐ELDOR main peaks with an increase in mixing time is ascribed to the effects of solid‐state dynamical processes that are slow on the ESR time scale and may thus be studied in ‘‘real time'' in such experiments. The analysis of spin relaxation in this study is enabled by a full Liouville space derivation of the combined effects of nuclear modulation and spin relaxation in 2D‐FTESR.},

For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

It is shown that (1) strong nuclear rf fields can split ESR lines, a phenomenon similar to ``spin‐tickling{\&}apos;{\&}apos; in NMR double resonance, (2) strong microwave fields in the presence of weaker, but saturating, nuclear rf fields can split ENDOR lines, and this latter effect is demonstrated experimentally.

The theory for this effect appears to be in very good agreement with detailed experimental studies on Coppinger{\&}apos;s radical. Other radicals are also found to exhibit such coherenceeffects.

The measured relaxation increment is compared to that of the force-free diffusion relaxation model, and the differences are related to a free energy for the oxygen association with different portions of the solute molecules. The free energy differences are small, on the order of -800 to -2000 J/mol, but are uniformly negative for all proton positions measured on the amino acids in water and reflect the energetic benefit of weak association of hydrophobic cosolutes. For glucose, CH proton positions report negative free energies for oxygen association, the magnitude of which depends on the solvent; however, the hydroxyl positions report positive free energy differences relative to the force-free diffusion model, which is consistent with partial occupancy in the OH region by a solvent hydrogen bond.},

The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

The widely used AMBER force fields (ff99, ff99SB, and ff03) were combined with four of the most commonly used explicit solvent models (TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP5P, and SPC/E). Significant differences in the specific solvation of chignolin among the studied water models were identified. Chignolin was highly solvated in TIP5P, whereas reduced specific solvation was found in the TIP4P, SPC/E, and TIP3P models for kinetic, thermodynamic, and both kinetic and thermodynamic reasons, respectively. The differences in specific solvation did not influence the dynamics of structured parts of the folded peptide. However, substantial differences between TIP5P and the other models were observed in the dynamics of unfolded chignolin, stability of salt bridges, and specific solvation of the backbone carbonyls of EK-peptide. Thus, we conclude that the choice of water model may affect the dynamics of flexible parts of proteins that are solvent-exposed. On the other hand, all water models should perform similarly for well-structured folded protein regions. The merits of the TIP3P model include its high and overestimated mobility, which accelerates simulation processes and thus effectively increases sampling.},

  abstract = {The magnetic field dependence of the water-proton spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) in tissues results from magnetic coupling to the protons of the rotationally immobilized components of the tissue. As a consequence, the magnetic field dependence of the water-proton (1/T1) is a scaled report of the field dependence of the (1/T1) rate of the solid components of the tissue. The proton spin-lattice relaxation rate may be represented generally as a power law: 1/T1omega = Aomega-b, where b is usually found to be in the range of 0.5-0.8. We have shown that this power law may arise naturally from localized structural fluctuations along the backbone in biopolymers that modulate the proton dipole-dipole couplings. The protons in a protein form a spin communication network described by a fractal dimension that is less than the Euclidean dimension. The model proposed accounts quantitatively for the proton spin-lattice relaxation rates measured in immobilized protein systems at different water contents, and provides a fundamental basis for understanding the parametric dependence of proton spin-lattice relaxation rates in dynamically heterogeneous systems, such as tissues.

  abstract      = {Site-directed labeling was used to obtain local information on the binding interface in a receptor-ligand complex, As a model we have chosen the specific association of the extracellular part of tissue factor (sTF) and factor VIIa (FVIIa), the primary initiator of the blood coagulation cascade. Different spectroscopic labels were covalently attached to an engineered cysteine in position 140 in sTF, a position normally occupied by a Phe residue previously characterized as an important contributor to the sTF:FVIIa interaction. Two spin labels, IPSL [N-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolidinyl etamide] and MTSSL [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate], and two fluorescent labels, IAEDANS [5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino) ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid] and BADAN [6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene], were used. Spectral data from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy showed a substantial change in the local environment of all labels when the sTF:FVIIa complex was formed. However, the interaction was probed differently by each label and these differences in spectral appearance could be attributed to differences in label properties such as size, polarity, and/or flexibility. Accordingly, molecular modeling data suggest that the most favorable orientations are unique for each label. Furthermore, line-shape simulations of EPR spectra and calculations based on fluorescence depolarization measurements provided additional details of the local environment of the labels, thereby confirming a tight protein-protein interaction between FVIIa and sTF when the complex is formed. The tightness of this local interaction is similar to that seen in the interior of globular proteins.},

These properties allow Nafion to be used in nanocomposite actuators, sensors and fuel cells. In situ experiments have shown that there is a water gradient within the Nafion membrane. The water gradient causes the alteration of other physical properties within the thickness of the membrane and has a drastic impact on the performance of the devices made of the Nafion membrane. Deriving closed-form equations and using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results, we bridge Nafion properties at the atomic scale and the macroscopic behavior of the membrane within a hierarchical multi-scale model. Multiple discrete simulation cells are selected across the thickness of the membrane with a wide range of water contents as representative volume elements (RVEs). The present framework is able to quantitatively predict the macroscopic properties of Nafion with the nanometric resolution regarding the water gradient across the membrane.},

  abstract = {Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine. In addition to its known receptor-mediated biological activities, MIF possesses a catalytic site of unknown function between subunits of a homotrimer. Each subunit contributes three $\beta$-strands to adjacent subunits to form a core seven-stranded $\beta$-sheet for each monomer. MIF monomers, dimers, or trimers have been reported, but the active form that binds and activates the MIF receptor (CD74) is still a matter of debate. A cysteine mutant (N110C) that covalently locks MIF into a trimer by forming a disulfide with Cys-80 of an adjacent subunit is used to study this issue. Partial catalytic activity and receptor binding to CD74 are retained by N110C (locked trimer), but there is no cellular signaling. Wild-type MIF-induced cellular signaling, in vivo lung neutrophil accumulation, and alveolar permeability are inhibited with a fivefold excess of N110C. NMR and size-exclusion chromatography with light scattering reveal that N110C can form a higher-order oligomer in equilibrium with a single locked trimer. The X-ray structure confirms a local conformational change that disrupts the subunit interface and results in global changes responsible for the oligomeric form. The structure also confirms these changes are consistent for the partial catalytic and receptor binding activities. The absence of any potential monomer and the retention of partial catalytic and receptor binding activities despite changes in conformation (and dynamics) in the mutant support an endogenous MIF trimer that binds and activates CD74 at nanomolar concentrations. This conclusion has implications for therapeutic development.},

The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

  abstract  = {For biomolecules in solution, changes in configurational entropy are thought to contribute substantially to the free energies of processes like binding and conformational change. In principle, the configurational entropy can be strongly affected by pairwise and higher-order correlations among conformational degrees of freedom. However, the literature offers mixed perspectives regarding the contributions that changes in correlations make to changes in configurational entropy for such processes. Here we take advantage of powerful techniques for simulation and entropy analysis to carry out rigorous in silico studies of correlation in binding and conformational changes. In particular, we apply information-theoretic expansions of the configurational entropy to well-sampled molecular dynamics simulations of a model host-guest system and the protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The results bear on the interpretation of NMR data, as they indicate that changes in correlation are important determinants of entropy changes for biologically relevant processes and that changes in correlation may either balance or reinforce changes in first-order entropy. The results also highlight the importance of main-chain torsions as contributors to changes in protein configurational entropy. As simulation techniques grow in power, the mathematical techniques used here will offer new opportunities to answer challenging questions about complex molecular systems.},

Operation in the fundamental modes, including the TE/sub 0,3,1/ mode at 237.91 GHz and the TE/sub 2,3,1/ at 233.15 GHz, is observed at output powers up to 70 W. Further, we demonstrate broadband continuous frequency tuning of the fundamental modes of the oscillator over a range of more than 2 GHz through variation of the magnetic field alone. We interpret these results in terms of smooth transitions between higher order axial modes of the resonator. The 460 GHz gyrotron is currently being processed for continuous duty operation, where it will serve as a microwave source for sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (dynamic nuclear polarization) studies at 16 T (700 MHz /sup 1/H), a field strength which is two-fold higher than has been accessible with previous technology. },

  abstract  = {Membrane-active peptides participate in many cellular processes, and therefore knowledge of their mode of interaction with phospholipids is essential for understanding their biological function. Here we present a new methodology based on electron spin-echo envelope modulation to probe, at a relatively high resolution, the location of membrane-bound lytic peptides and to study their effect on the water concentration profile of the membrane. As a first example, we determined the location of the N-terminus of two membrane-active amphipathic peptides, the 26-mer bee venom melittin and a de novo designed 15-mer D,L-amino acid amphipathic peptide (5D-L9K6C), both of which are antimicrobial and bind and act similarly on negatively charged membranes. A nitroxide spin label was introduced to the N-terminus of the peptides and measurements were performed either in H2O solutions with deuterated model membranes or in D2O solutions with nondeuterated model membranes. The lipids used were dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), (DPPC/PG (7:3 w/w)), egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PG (PC/PG (7:3 w/w)), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PG (PE/PG, 7:3w/w). The modulation induced by the 2H nuclei was determined and compared with a series of controls that produced a reference "ruler". Actual estimated distances were obtained from a quantitative analysis of the modulation depth based on a simple model of an electron spin situated at a certain distance from the bottom of a layer with homogeneously distributed deuterium nuclei. The N-terminus of both peptides was found to be in the solvent layer in both the DPPC/PG and PC/PG membranes. For PE/PG, a further displacement into the solvent was observed. The addition of the peptides was found to change the water distribution in the membrane, making it "flatter" and increasing the penetration depth into the hydrophobic region.},

Shaped broadband excitation pulses designed using optimal control theory (OCT) have been tested with this device at X-band frequency (9 GHz). FT-EPR experiments on organic radicals in solution have been performed with the new pulses, designed for uniform excitation over a significantly increased bandwidth compared to a classical rectangular $\pi$/2 pulse of the same B(1) amplitude. The concept of a dead-time compensated prefocused pulse has been introduced to EPR with a self-refocusing of 200 ns after the end of the pulse. Echo-like refocused signals have been recorded and compared to the performance of a classical Hahn-echo sequence. The impulse response function of the microwave setup has been measured and incorporated into the algorithm for designing OCT pulses, resulting in further significant improvements in performance. Experimental limitations and potential new applications of OCT pulses in EPR spectroscopy will be discussed.},

abstract = {Human monoamine oxidase A (hMAOA) is considered to be unique among mammalian MAOs in having a non-conservative Glu-X-Lys mutation (X being 151 in MAOAs and 142 in MAOB's), which is suggested to be the reason for its monomeric structure. This hypothesis has been tested in this work. A pargyline based nitroxide spin labeled irreversible inhibitor (ParSL) was used as a MAO active site specific spin probe to measure intersubunit distances in detergent (octyl beta-d-glucopyranoside, OGP) purified and OMM bound forms by a pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopic (PDS) technique. In a parallel approach, the covalent flavin cofactor present in the MAO active sites was reduced to its respective anionic flavin semiquinone and used for measuring inter-flavin distances in detergent purified samples. The measured interspin distances are within 0.1-0.3 nm of those estimated from the available dimeric crystal structures of human MAOB and rat MAOA and show that all human and rat MAOs exist as dimers in the OMM. In the OGP micelle, however, human and rat MAOAs exist only partially ({\textless}or=50{\%}) as dimers, whereas human and rat MAOBs exist entirely as dimers. The Lys-151-Glu mutant of human MAOA and the Glu-142-Lys mutant of human MAOB exhibit similar spectral properties as the corresponding wild-type enzymes. Therefore, no role of the Glu-X residue in stabilizing dimeric structures of MAOs was found. The monomeric crystal structure reported for human MAOA is thus a result of its instability in the OGP micelles. The general applicability of the PDS technique to structural studies of membrane proteins in their native membrane environments and detergent purified forms is discussed.},

abstract = {Experimental tumors contain a significant fraction of microregions that are chronically or transiently hypoxic. Experimental evidence showing that hypoxia (and subsequent reoxyenation) may have a profound impact on malignant progression and on responsiveness to therapy is growing. The clinical relevance of tumor oxygenation in human solid malignancies is under investigation.  We have developed and validated a clinically applicable method for measurement of tumor oxygenation in locally advanced cancer of the uterine cervix using a computerized polarographic electrode system. Applying this procedure in patients with cervical cancers [{\&}ge;]3 cm in diameter, who gave informed consent, we have been studying the clinical relevance of tumor oxygenation prospectively since 1989.  As of June 1995, 103 patients with advanced cancers of the uterine cervix [Federation Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes (FIGO) stages Ib, bulky (n = 13), IIa and IIb (n = 51), IIIa and IIIb (n = 34), and IVa and IVb (n = 5)] had entered the study. Fifty {\%} of the patients had carcinomas with median pO2 readings {\textless}10 mm Hg, referred to as hypoxic tumors.  Tumor oxygenation was found to be independent of various patient demographics and also of pretreatment tumor characteristics, such as clinical tumor stage and size, histological type, and differentiation. However, histopathological examination of the surgical specimens following radical tumor resection in 47 patients showed that low-pO2 tumors exhibited larger tumor extensions and more frequent (occult) parametrial spread, as well as lymph-vascular space involvement, compared to well-oxygenated tumors of similar clinical stage and size. Forty-two patients completing primary radiation therapy and 47 patients who underwent radical surgery were analyzed for treatment outcome after a median observation period of 28 months (range, 3-76 months). Patients with hypoxic tumors had significantly worse disease-free and overall survival probabilities compared to patients with nonhypoxic tumors. Cox regession analysis identified tumor oxygenation and FIGO stage as the most important independent prognostic factors. The poorer outcome of the patients with hypoxic tumors was mainly due to locoregional failures with and without distant metastases, irrespective of whether surgery or radiation was applied as primary treatment.  Tumor oxygenation as measured with a standardized polarographic method proved to be a powerful new pretherapeutic{\ldots}},

  abstract = {A novel fast and quiet method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is introduced which creates new opportunities for imaging in medicine and materials science. The method is called SWIFT, sweep imaging with Fourier transformation. In SWIFT, time-domain signals are acquired in a time-shared manner during a swept radiofrequency excitation of the nuclear spins. With negligible time between excitation and signal acquisition, new possibilities exist for imaging objects consisting of spins with extremely fast transverse relaxation rates, such as macromolecules, semi-solids, and quadrupolar nuclei. The field gradient used for spatial-encoding is not pulsed on and off, but rather is stepped in orientation in an incremental manner, which results in low acoustic noise. This unique acquisition method is expected to be relatively insensitive to sample motion, which is important for imaging live objects. Additionally, the frequency-swept excitation distributes the signal energy in time and thus dynamic range requirements for proper signal digitization are reduced compared with conventional MRI. For demonstration, images of a plastic object and cortical bone are shown.},

The heats of solution of the crystalline alkali halides are then used to show that only oppositely charged ions of equal water affinity spontaneously form inner sphere ion pairs, and that this controls ion binding to proteins. The net charge on a protein is a major determinant of its solubility. Finally, the surface potential difference and surface tension at an air-salt solution interface are used to generate a simple model for how ions affect protein stability and solubility through indirect interactions at the protein-solution interface.

The vibrational couplings that govern energy relaxation in H2O remain difficult to characterize because of the limitations of current methods to visualize inter- and intramolecular motions simultaneously. Using a new sub-70 fs broadband mid-infrared source, we performed two-dimensional infrared, transient absorption and polarization anisotropy spectroscopy of H2O by exciting the OH stretching transition and characterizing the response from 1,350 cm(-1) to 4,000 cm(-1). These spectra reveal vibrational transitions at all frequencies simultaneous to the excitation, including pronounced cross-peaks to the bend vibration and a continuum of induced absorptions to combination bands that are not present in linear spectra. These observations provide evidence for strong mixing of inter- and intramolecular vibrations in liquid H2O, and illustrate the shortcomings of traditional relaxation models.},

abstract = {With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone. We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, Risk Shrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. RiskShrink mimics the performance of an oracle for selective wavelet reconstruction as well as it is possible to do so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures, RiskShrink is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes within a factor log2n of the performance of piecewise polynomial and variableknot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast, it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced to rely on data alone.},

We find that the kinetic rates of the conformational changes in two homologous globular domains differ by more than an order of magnitude. The characteristic time constants are approximately 490 micros for the transitions in the C-terminal domain and approximately 20 ms for those in the N-terminal domain of the protein.

abstract = {A review. Proton-electron double-resonance imaging (PEDRI) is an alternative method to EPR for detecting and imaging free radicals in biol. samples or animals. PEDRI uses the Overhauser effect, and involves collecting a proton NMR image while irradiating the EPR of the free radical under study. The spatial resoln. in PEDRI is not affected by the linewidth of the free radical's EPR resonance. An important development of the technique is field-cycled PEDRI (FC-PEDRI), in which the applied magnetic field is switched between two levels during the pulse sequence in order to decrease nonresonant RF power deposition and to increase sensitivity. A spectroscopic version of FC-PEDRI, called field-cycled dynamic nuclear polarization (FC-DNP) is useful for studying low concns. of free radicals and enables EPR spectra to be obtained via the Overhauser effect. This Chapter describes the techniques and practical implementation of PEDRI and related techniques. Applications of the methods are described, and likely future uses of the techniques are discussed.

  abstract = {Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR), we measure the rotational mobility of probe molecules highly diluted in deeply supercooled bulk water and negligibly constrained by the possible ice fraction. The mobility increases above the putative glass transition temperature of water, T(g) = 136 K, and smoothly connects to the thermodynamically stable region by traversing the so called "no man's land" (the range 150-235 K), where it is believed that the homogeneous nucleation of ice suppresses the liquid water. Two coexisting fractions of the probe molecules are evidenced. The 2 fractions exhibit different mobility and fragility; the slower one is thermally activated (low fragility) and is larger at low temperatures below a fragile-to-strong dynamic cross-over at approximately 225 K. The reorientation of the probe molecules decouples from the viscosity below approximately 225 K. The translational diffusion of water exhibits a corresponding decoupling at the same temperature [Chen S-H, et al. (2006) The violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation in supercooled water. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:12974-12978]. The present findings are consistent with key issues concerning both the statics and the dynamics of supercooled water, namely the large structural fluctuations [Poole PH, Sciortino F, Essmann U, Stanley HE (1992) Phase behavior of metastable water. Nature 360:324-328] and the fragile-to-strong dynamic cross-over at approximately 228 K [Ito K, Moynihan CT, Angell CA (1999) Thermodynamic determination of fragility in liquids and a fragile-to-strong liquid transition in water.

Computational (DFT), chemical reactivity, and electrochemical studies all suggest that the purified Gd2@C79N, with the heterofullerene cage, (C79N)5- has comparable stability with the better known isoelectronic (C80)6- cage species. These results describe an exceptionally stable paramagnetic molecule with low chemical reactivity and with the unpaired electron spin density mainly localized on the internal diatomic gadolinium cluster and not on the heterofullerene cage. EPR studies confirm that the spin state of Gd2@C79N is characterized by a half-integer spin quantum number of S = 15/2. The spin (S = 1/2) on the N atom of the fullerene cage and two octet spins (S = 7/2) of two encapsulated gadoliniums are coupled with each other in a ferromagnetic manner with a small zero-field splitting parameter D. Because the central line of Gd2@C79N is due to the Kramer's doublet with a half-integer spin quantum number of S = 15/2, the relatively sharp EPR line is prominent and the anisotropic nature of the line is weak. Interestingly, in contrast with most Gd3+ ion environments, the central EPR line (g=1.978) is observable even at room temperature in a toluene solution.},

  abstract = {The dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) process in solids depends on the magnitudes of hyperfine interactions between unpaired electrons and their neighboring (core) nuclei, and on the dipole-dipole interactions between all nuclei in the sample. The polarization enhancement of the bulk nuclei has been typically described in terms of a hyperfine-assisted polarization of a core nucleus by microwave irradiation followed by a dipolar-assisted spin diffusion process in the core-bulk nuclear system. This work presents a theoretical approach for the study of this combined process using a density matrix formalism. In particular, solid effect DNP on a single electron coupled to a nuclear spin system is considered, taking into account the interactions between the spins as well as the main relaxation mechanisms introduced via the electron, nuclear, and cross-relaxation rates. The basic principles of the DNP-assisted spin diffusion mechanism, polarizing the bulk nuclei, are presented, and it is shown that the polarization of the core nuclei and the spin diffusion process should not be treated separately. To emphasize this observation the coherent mechanism driving the pure spin diffusion process is also discussed. In order to demonstrate the effects of the interactions and relaxation mechanisms on the enhancement of the nuclear polarization, model systems of up to ten spins are considered and polarization buildup curves are simulated. A linear chain of spins consisting of a single electron coupled to a core nucleus, which in turn is dipolar coupled to a chain of bulk nuclei, is considered. The interaction and relaxation parameters of this model system were chosen in a way to enable a critical analysis of the polarization enhancement of all nuclei, and are not far from the values of (13)C nuclei in frozen (glassy) organic solutions containing radicals, typically used in DNP at high fields. Results from the simulations are shown, demonstrating the complex dependences of the DNP-assisted spin diffusion process on variations of the relevant parameters. In particular, the effect of the spin lattice relaxation times on the polarization buildup times and the resulting end polarization are discussed, and the quenching of the polarizations by the hyperfine interaction is demonstrated.},

Several breakthroughs during the past few years may finally remove Ras from the list of undruggable proteins.

Caveolae at the plasma membrane can be removed by endocytosis to regulate their surface density or can be disassembled and their structural components degraded. Coat proteins, called cavins, work together with caveolins to regulate the formation of caveolae but also have the potential to dynamically transmit signals that originate in caveolae to various cellular destinations.

  abstract = {We report an approach that extends the applicability of ultrasensitive force-gradient detection of magnetic resonance to samples with spin-lattice relaxation times (T (1)) as short as a single cantilever period. To demonstrate the generality of the approach, which relies on detecting either cantilever frequency or phase, we used it to detect electron spin resonance from a T (1) = 1 ms nitroxide spin probe in a thin film at 4.2 K and 0.6 T. By using a custom-fabricated cantilever with a 4 microm-diameter nickel tip, we achieve a magnetic resonance sensitivity of 400 Bohr magnetons in a 1 Hz bandwidth. A theory is presented that quantitatively predicts both the lineshape and the magnitude of the observed cantilever frequency shift as a function of field and cantilever-sample separation. Good agreement was found between nitroxide T (1) 's measured mechanically and inductively, indicating that the cantilever magnet is not an appreciable source of spin-lattice relaxation here. We suggest that the new approach has a number of advantages that make it well suited to push magnetic resonance detection and imaging of nitroxide spin labels in an individual macromolecule to single-spin sensitivity.},

Compn. of the complexes was varied by changing the pMAA/pNIPA molar ratio r and pH. Soly. of the pMAA/pNIPA complexes increased with increasing the content of pMAA in the complex and decreased with decreasing pH. According to HS-DSC, the phase transition behavior of pNIPA upon heating is significantly modified in complexes with pMAA. Thus, decreasing pH from pH 7 to 3 or increasing the content of pMAA decreases the phase transition temp. of the complexes by 4-5 DegC with respect to the lower crit. soln. temp. (LCST) of pure pNIPA. At the same time, the enthalpy of the transition decreases down to zero and the transition width increases by more than 1 order of magnitude. Thermograms of the sol. complexes (4.3 {\textless} pH {\textless} 6.3, r = 2.7) show an addnl. cooperative transition preceding the phase sepn. upon heating. This transition is accompanied by increasing the sedimentation coeff. of the complexes and decreasing their mean hydrodynamic diam. Exptl. data suggest that the pMAA/pNIPA complexes are able to fold cooperatively to a compact structure without a loss of soly. at temps. below the LCST of pNIPA. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The domains AMPbd and LID execute large-amplitude movements during catalysis. Backbone dynamics of ligand-free and AP(5)A-inhibitor-bound AKeco is studied with slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) (15)N relaxation, an approach particularly suited when the global (tau(m)) and the local (tau) motions are likely to be coupled. For AKeco tau(m) = 15.1 ns, whereas for AKeco*AP(5)A tau(m) = 11.6 ns. The CORE domain of AKeco features an average squared order parameter, , of 0.84 and correlation times tau(f) = 5-130 ps. Most of the AKeco*AP(5)A backbone features = 0.90 and tau(f) = 33-193 ps. These data are indicative of relative rigidity. Domains AMPbd and LID of AKeco, and loops beta(1)/alpha(1), alpha(2)/alpha(3), alpha(4)/beta(3), alpha(5)/beta(4), and beta(8)/alpha(7) of AKeco*AP(5)A, feature a novel type of protein flexibility consisting of nanosecond peptide plane reorientation about the C(i-1)(alpha)-C(i)(alpha) axis, with correlation time tau(perpendicular) = 5.6-11.3 ns. The other microdynamic parameters underlying this dynamic model include S(2) = 0.13-0.5, tau(parallel) on the ps time scale, and a diffusion tilt beta(MD) ranging from 12 to 21 degrees. For the ligand-free enzyme the tau(perpendicular) mode was shown to represent segmental domain motion, accompanied by conformational exchange contributions R(ex) {\textless} or = 4.4 s(-1). Loop alpha(4)/beta(3) and alpha(5)/beta(4) dynamics in AKeco*AP(5)A is related to the "energetic counter-balancing of substrate binding" effect apparently driving kinase catalysis. The other flexible AKeco*AP(5)A loops may relate to domain motion toward product release.},

  abstract      = {Biological water at the interface of proteins is critical to their equilibrium structures and enzyme function and to phenomena such as molecular recognition and protein-protein interactions. To actually probe the dynamics of water structure at the surface, we must examine the protein itself, without disrupting the native structure, and the ultrafast elementary processes of hydration. Here we report direct study, with femtosecond resolution, of the dynamics of hydration at the surface of the enzyme protein Subtilisin Carlsberg, whose single Trp residue (Trp-113) was used as an intrinsic biological fluorescent probe. For the protein, we observed two well separated dynamical solvation times, 0.8 ps and 38 ps, whereas in bulk water, we obtained 180 fs and 1.1 ps. We also studied a covalently bonded probe at a separation of approximately 7 A and observed the near disappearance of the 38-ps component, with solvation being practically complete in (time constant) 1.5 ps. The degree of rigidity of the probe (anisotropy decay) and of the water environment (protein vs. micelle) was also studied. These results show that hydration at the surface is a dynamical process with two general types of trajectories, those that result from weak interactions with the selected surface site, giving rise to bulk-type solvation (approximately 1 ps), and those that have a stronger interaction, enough to define a rigid water structure, with a solvation time of 38 ps, much slower than that of the bulk. At a distance of approximately 7 A from the surface, essentially all trajectories are bulk-type. The theoretical framework for these observations is discussed.},

Although FDM is capable to extract accurately the parameters of narrow spectral peaks, in the presence of broad peaks (or strong background spectrum) and noise, the FDM ersatz spectrum, i.e., I($\omega$)=∑ k d k /($\omega$ k −$\omega$), maybe distorted in some regions and be sensitive to the FDM parameters, such as window size, window position, etc. Some simple hybrid methods, that can correct the ersatz spectrum, are discussed. However, a more consistent approach, the multiscale FDM, is introduced to solve the instability problem, in which some coarse basis vectors describing (in low resolution) the global behavior of the spectrum are added to the narrow band Fourier basis. The multiscale FDM is both stable and accurate, even when the total size of the basis (i.e., the number of coarse plus narrow band basis vectors) used is much smaller than what would previously be considered as necessary for FDM. This, in turn, significantly reduces the computation cost. Extension of the 1D multiscale FDM to a multidimensional case is also presented.},

These measurements are made possible by the recent development of a new instrumental and methodological approach based on Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This technique selectively amplifies 1H NMR signals of hydration water around a spin label that is attached to a molecular site of interest. The selective 1H NMR amplification within molecular length scales of a spin label is achieved by utilizing short-distance range ({\~{}}r−3) magnetic dipolar interactions between the 1H spin of water and the electron spin of a nitroxide radical-based label. Key features include the fact that only minute quantities ({\textless}10 $\mu$l) and dilute (≥100 $\mu$M) sample concentrations are needed. There is no size limit on the macromolecule or molecular assembly to be analyzed. Hydration water with translational correlation times between 10 and 800 ps is measured within {\~{}}10 {\AA} distance of the spin label, encompassing the typical thickness of a hydration layer with three water molecules across. The hydration water moving within this time scale has significant implications, as this is what is modulated whenever macromolecules or molecular assemblies undergo interactions, binding or conformational changes. We demonstrate, with the examples of polymer complexation, protein aggregation and lipid–polymer interaction, that the measurements of interfacial hydration dynamics can sensitively and site specifically probe macromolecular interactions.},

abstract = {Proteins of the proteorhodopsin (PR) family are found abundantly in many marine bacteria in the photic zone of the oceans. They are colour-tuned to their environment. The green absorbing species has been shown to act as a light-driven proton pump and thus could form a potential source of energy. The pK(a) of the primary proton acceptor is close to the pH of seawater which could also indicate a regulatory role. Here, we review and summarize our own recent findings in the context of known data and present some new results. Proton transfer in vitro by PR is shown by a fluorescence assay which confirms a pH dependent vectoriality. Previously reported low diffracting 2D crystal preparations of PR are assessed for their use for solid-state NMR by two dimensional (13)C-(13)C DARR spectra. (15)N-(1)H HETCOR MAS NMR experiments show bound water in the vicinity of the protonated Schiff base which could play a role in proton transfer. The effect of highly conserved H75 onto the properties of the chromophore has been investigated by single site mutations. They do show a pronounced effect onto the optical absorption maximum and the pK(a) of the proton acceptor but have only a small effect onto the (15)N chemical shifts of the protonated Schiff base.},

The resulting CNT/Nafion modified glassy-carbon electrodes exhibit a strong and stable electrocatalytic response toward hydrogen peroxide. The marked acceleration of the hydrogen peroxide redox process is very attractive for the operation of oxidase-based amperometric biosensors, as illustrated for the highly selective low-potential (-0.05 V vs Ag/AgCl) biosensing of glucose.

  abstract = {The modeling of protein-protein complexes greatly benefits from the incorporation of experimental distance restraints. Pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy is one such powerful technique for obtaining long-range distance restraints in protein complexes. Measurements of the dipolar interaction between two spins placed specifically within a protein complex give information about the spin-spin separation distance. We have developed a convenient method to incorporate such long-range distance information in the modeling of protein-protein complexes that is based on rigid body refinement of the protein components with the software Crystallography and NMR System (CNS). Factors affecting convergence such as number of restraints, error allocation scheme, and number and position of spin labeling sites were investigated with real and simulated data. The use of 4 to 5 different labeling sites on each protein component was found to provide sufficient coverage for producing accuracies limited by the uncertainty in the spin-label conformation within the complex. With an asymmetric scheme of allocating this uncertainty, addition of simulated restraints revealed the importance of longer distances within a limited set of total restraints. We present two case studies: (1) refinement of the complex formed between the histidine kinase CheA and its coupling protein CheW, and (2) refinement of intra-helical separations in the protein a-synuclein bound to micelles.},

Resolving the geometric and electronic structure of this cluster in its highest metastable catalytic state (designated S3) is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of O-O bond formation. Here, multifrequency, multidimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals that all four manganese ions of the catalyst are structurally and electronically similar immediately before the final oxygen evolution step; they all exhibit a 4+ formal oxidation state and octahedral local geometry. Only one structural model derived from quantum chemical modeling is consistent with all magnetic resonance data; its formation requires the binding of an additional water molecule. O-O bond formation would then proceed by the coupling of two proximal manganese-bound oxygens in the transition state of the cofactor.},

  abstract = {The focus in protein folding has been very much on the protein backbone and sidechains. However, hydration waters make comparable contributions to the structure and energy of proteins. The coupling between fast hydration dynamics and protein dynamics is considered to play an important role in protein folding. Fundamental questions of protein hydration include, how far out into the solvent does the influence of the biomolecule reach, how is the water affected, and how are the properties of the hydration water influenced by the separation between protein molecules in solution? We show here that Terahertz spectroscopy directly probes such solvation dynamics around proteins, and determines the width of the dynamical hydration layer. We also investigate the dependence of solvation dynamics on protein concentration. We observe an unexpected nonmonotonic trend in the measured terahertz absorbance of the five helix bundle protein lambda(6-85)* as a function of the protein: water molar ratio. The trend can be explained by overlapping solvation layers around the proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate water dynamics in the solvation layer around one protein to be distinct from bulk water out to approximately 10 A. At higher protein concentrations such that solvation layers overlap, the calculated absorption spectrum varies nonmonotonically, qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. The experimental data suggest an influence on the correlated water network motion beyond 20 A, greater than the pure structural correlation length usually observed.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the interfacial diffusion coefficient of the surface hydration layer of lipid vesicles in dilute solutions are presented. This was made possible by the greatly enhanced sensitivity and unique contrast provided by the site-specific and selective Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization of solvent molecules that approach nitroxide radical-based spin labels within {\textless}5-10 A. All experiments were carried out using minute microliter sample volumes of lipid vesicle solutions, using low spin label concentrations ({\textless}2 mol {\%}) and under physiological conditions. This presents unprecedented sensitivity for analyzing interfacial solvent diffusion of macromolecules and their assemblies in solutions and highlights the feasibility of investigating precious samples. Interfacial diffusion on DOTAP (1,2-DiOleoyl-3-TrimethylAmmonium-Propane) and DPPC (1,2-DiPalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-PhosphoCholine) surfaces are further analyzed as a function of temperature to determine the activation energy of their hydration layer dynamics. The temperature-dependent analysis across the phase transition of DPPC concludes that the hydration water with 100-200 ps dynamics displays Arrhenius behavior and does not undergo a phase transition unlike the lipid chains. We also discuss the advantages of determining the activation energy of diffusion as a general approach to comparing interfacial diffusivity on surfaces that have vastly different charge topologies and, thus, may display different distances of closest approach between the spin label placed at the surface and the protons of hydration water. The further development and application of this technique is expected to facilitate the study of membrane dynamics and their phase behavior, including the formation of lipid rafts, with lipid-specific resolution.},

abstract = {The use of various binitroxides, with both radical sites of similar reactivity, as mediator in the controlled radical polymn. of styrene was examd. and the rate consts. of the reactions involved were detd. at 130 DegC. Typical features of a controlled radical polymn. were obsd. in the early stage of the polymn., leading to the formation of two-arm macromols. contg. the binitroxide at the core. At higher conversion, however, continuous decompn. reaction resulted in a break of the two-arm macromols. into a dead chain having an unsatn. end group and a living chain capped by a modified binitroxide. The latter had the free nitroxide site inactivated by conversion into hydroxylamine. The extent of this side reaction was much larger than in classical nitroxide-mediated controlled radical polymn. of styrene. This feature was assigned to the structure of the growing chains. As they contain the binitroxide at the core, the activation reaction produces a propagating chain and a nitroxide to which another polymeric chain remains attached by the second alkoxyamine bond. Thus, deactivation of the propagating radical by nitroxide is a bimol. process between two macromol. species. This unique situation had no significant effect on the rate const. of the alkoxyamine homolytic dissocn., but more importantly decreased the rate const. of recombination. The latter was 30 times lower than that detd. for the recombination of TEMPO with polystyryl radical at 130 DegC. The slow recombination was assigned to steric hindrance and resulted in an unusually high concn. of nitroxide in the polymn. medium, together with a large concn. of propagating radicals. A consequence of the high concn. of both radicals was the enhanced rate of hydrogen transfer from the active species to the persistent radical, leading to alkoxyamine bond breaking and, hence, to arm sepn.

  abstract = {Spin-dynamics of the spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP) P(700)(+)A(1A)(-) in the photosystem I (PSI) reaction center protein have been investigated with high-frequency (HF), time-resolved EPR spectroscopy. The superior spectral resolution of HF EPR enables spin-dynamics for both the donor and acceptor radicals in the pair to be monitored independently. Decay constants of each spin were measured as a function of temperature and compared to data obtained at X-band EPR. Relaxation times, T(1), and decay rates, k(S), are the same at both X- and D-band magnetic fields. The spin-dynamics within the radical pair were determined from theoretical simulation of experimental time-resolved HF EPR spectra. At low temperatures, T {\textless} 60 K, the decay of the SCRP from the singlet state, k(S), is the predominant process, while at high temperatures, T {\textgreater} 130 K, the T(1) relaxation is much faster than k(S). The recombination rate k(S) was observed to decrease as the temperature is increased. These EPR spectral results are in agreement with previously reported optical measurements of P(700)(+)A(1)(-) radical pair recombination.},

abstract = {Most biologically relevant environments involve highly concentrated macromolecular solutions and most biological processes involve macromolecules that diffuse and interact with other macromolecules. Macromolecular crowding is a general phenomenon that strongly affects the transport properties of macromolecules (rotational and translational diffusion) as well as the position of their equilibria. NMR methods can provide information on molecular interactions, as well as on translational and rotational diffusion. In fact, rotational diffusion, through its determinant role in NMR relaxation, places a practical limit on the systems that can be studied by NMR. While in dilute solutions of non-aggregating macromolecules this limit is set by macromolecular size, in crowded solutions excluded volume effects can have a strong effect on the observed diffusion rates. Hydrodynamic theory offers some insight into the magnitude of crowding effects on NMR observable parameters.},

abstract = {New theoretical and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of arrays of multiple receiver coils. Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

In addition to transitions between high- and low-density amorphous solids, and between high- and low-density liquids, a fragile-to-strong liquid transition has recently been proposed, and supported by evidence from the behaviour of deeply supercooled bilayer water confined in hydrophilic slit pores. Here we report evidence from molecular dynamics simulations for another type of first-order phase transition--a liquid-to-bilayer amorphous transition--above the freezing temperature of bulk water at atmospheric pressure. This transition occurs only when water is confined in a hydrophobic slit pore with a width of less than one nanometre. On cooling, the confined water, which has an imperfect random hydrogen-bonded network, transforms into a bilayer amorphous phase with a perfect network (owing to the formation of various hydrogen-bonded polygons) but no long-range order. The transition shares some characteristics with those observed in tetrahedrally coordinated substances such as liquid silicon, liquid carbon and liquid phosphorus.},

The development of methods to crystallize bacteriorhodopsin have allowed it to be studied with high-resolution X-ray diffraction, opening the possibility to advance substantially our knowledge of the structure and mechanism of this light-driven proton pump. A key step is to obtain the structures of the intermediate states formed during the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin. One difficulty in these studies is how to trap selectively the intermediates at low temperatures and determine quantitatively their amounts in a photosteady state. In this paper we review the procedures for trapping the K, L, M and N intermediates of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle and describe the difference absorption spectra accompanying the transformation of the all-trans-bacteriorhodopsin into each intermediate. This provides the means for quantitative analysis of the light-induced mixtures of different intermediates produced by illumination of the pigment at low temperatures.},

At all temperatures probed, spanning 1.03-1.06 T(g), each of the three probes exhibits rotational correlation times, $\tau$(c), that span more than a decade, consistent with the presence of spatially heterogeneous dynamics in OTP. No trend is found as a function of temperature, but a trend as a function of probe is observed: Average probe rotational correlation time scales inversely with breadth of SM $\tau$(c) distribution, with faster probes exhibiting broader $\tau$(c) distributions. This implies that dynamic exchange occurs on and below time scales associated with probe rotation. Extrapolating FWHM of rotational relaxation times to the structural relaxation time of the host shows that the $\tau$(c) distribution would span nearly two decades in the limit of no probe temporal averaging. Comparison with SM measurements in glycerol suggests that OTP demonstrates a greater degree of spatially heterogeneous dynamics in this temperature range than does glycerol.},

  abstract = {Tikhonov regularization (TIKR) has been demonstrated as a powerful and valuable method for the determination of distance distributions of spin-pairs in bi-labeled biomolecules directly from pulsed ESR signals. TIKR is a direct method, which requires no iteration, and, therefore, provides a rapid and unique solution. However, the distribution obtained tends to exhibit oscillatory excursions with negative portions in the presence of finite noise, especially in the peripheral regions of the distribution. The Shannon-Jaynes entropy of a probability distribution provides an intrinsic non-negativity constraint on the probability distribution and an unbiased way of obtaining information from incomplete data. We describe how the maximum entropy regularization method (MEM) may be applied to solve the ill-posed nature of the dipolar signal in pulsed ESR. We make use of it to suppress the negative excursions of the distance distribution and to increase the tolerance to noise in the dipolar signal. Model studies and experimental data are investigated, and they show that, with the initial or "seed" probability distribution that is required for MEM taken as the TIKR result, then MEM is able to provide a regularized solution, subject to the non-negativity constraint, and it is effective in dealing with noise that is problematic for TIKR. In addition we have incorporated into our MEM method the ability to extract the intermolecular dipolar component, which is embedded in the raw experimental data. We find that MEM minimization, which is implemented iteratively, is greatly accelerated using the TIKR result as the seed, and it converges more successfully. Thus we regard the MEM method as a complement to TIKR by securing a positive pair distance distribution and enhancing the accuracy of TIKR.},

The CP29 subunit of photosystem II has been proposed to be the site of qE quenching and shown to bind DCCD. We have hypothesised, on the basis of the CP29 protein sequence and of the structure of light-harvesting complex II protein, that glutamic acid 166 is the DCCD binding site. In this study, we have produced recombinant proteins either with wild-type sequence or carrying a mutation on the 166 position. We show that the mutant protein does not bind DCCD.

In the temp. region of the main transition, the TEMPO parameter increased rapidly, then gradually with increasing temp., which could be explained by the eutectic phase diagram. The rotational correlation time of a spin probe 16-doxylstearic acid and the order parameter of 5-doxylstearic acid in the aq. dispersion system of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine revealed that the motion of the alkyl chain in the liq. crystal state was hindered in the center of the membrane as well as near the surface by the adsorption of (+)-catechin.

abstract = {Archaeal and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 contain a unique post-translationally modified histidine residue called diphthamide, which is the target of diphtheria toxin. The biosynthesis of diphthamide was proposed to involve three steps, with the first being the formation of a C-C bond between the histidine residue and the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). However, further details of the biosynthesis remain unknown. Here we present structural and biochemical evidence showing that the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis in the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii uses a novel iron-sulphur-cluster enzyme, Dph2. Dph2 is a homodimer and each of its monomers can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Biochemical data suggest that unlike the enzymes in the radical SAM superfamily, Dph2 does not form the canonical 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. Instead, it breaks the C(gamma,Met)-S bond of SAM and generates a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical. Our results suggest that P. horikoshii Dph2 represents a previously unknown, SAM-dependent, [4Fe-4S]-containing enzyme that catalyses unprecedented chemistry.},

  abstract   = {The study of intermolecular collisions and bonding interactions in solutions is of critical importance in understanding and predicting solute/solvent properties. Previous work has established that stable paramagnetic nitroxide molecules are excellent probes of intermolecular interactions for hydrogen bonding in polar solvents. In this study, 1H, 2H, 13C, 15N NMR and liquid/liquid intermolecular transfer dynamic nuclear polarization (L2IT DNP) results are obtained for the paramagnetic probe molecule, TEMPO, interacting with the common aprotic and protic polar solvents, CH3CN and CH3CONH2, yielding a profile of both dipolar and scalar interactions. A significant scalar contact hyperfine is observed for the N-O...H-C interaction (13CH3 hyperfine, a/h=0.66 MHz) in the CH3CN/TEMPO system, whereas the N-O...H-C and N-O...H-N interactions for the TEMPO/CH3CONH2 system yield 13CH3 and 15N hyperfine couplings of a/h=0.16 and -0.50 MHz, respectively. The distance and attitude of the scalar interaction for the nitroxide hydrogen bonding at the methyl group in CH3CN and the amino group in CH3CONH2 are computed using density functional theory (DFT), yielding good agreement with the experimental results. These results show that the hyperfine coupling provides a sensitive probe of weak hydrogen-bonding interactions in solution.},

  abstract  = {Electrostatic influences on NMR parameters are well accepted. Experimental and computational routes have been long pursued to understand and utilize such Stark effects. However, existing approaches are largely indirect informants on electric fields, and/or are complicated by multiple causal factors in spectroscopic change. We present a system to directly measure quadrupolar Stark effects from an applied electric (E) field. Our apparatus and applications are relevant in two contexts. Each uses a radiofrequency (rf) E field at twice the nuclear Larmor frequency (2omega(0)). The mechanism is a distortion of the E-field gradient tensor that is linear in the amplitude (E(0)) of the rf E field. The first uses 2omega(0) excitation of double-quantum transitions for times similar to T(1) (the longitudinal spin relaxation time). This perturbs the steady state distribution of spin population. Nonlinear analysis versus E(0) can be used to determine the Stark response rate. The second context uses POWER (perturbations observed with enhanced resolution) NMR. Here, coherent, short-time ({\textless}{\textless}T(2), the transverse relaxation rate) excitation at 2omega(0) is synchronized with an NMR multiple-pulse line-narrowing sequence. Linear analysis of the Stark response is then possible: a quadrupolar multiplet with splitting proportional to E(0). The POWER sequence converts the 2omega(0) interaction from off-diagonal/nonsecular to the familiar diagonal form (I(z)(2)) of static quadrupole interactions. Meanwhile, background contributions to line width are averaged to zero, providing orders-of-magnitude resolution enhancement for correspondingly high sensitivity to the Stark effect. Using GaAs as a test case with well-defined Stark response, we provide the first demonstration of the 2omega(0) effect at high-field (14.1 T) and room temperature. This, along with the simplicity of our apparatus and spectral approach, may facilitate extensions to a wider array of material and molecular systems. The POWER context, which has not previously been tested, is detailed here with new design insights. Several key aspects are demonstrated here, while complete implementation is to be presented at a later time. At present, we (1) account for finite pulse times in pulse sequence design, (2) demonstrate two-channel phase coherence for magnetic (omega(0)) and electric (2omega(0)) excitation, and (3) provide line narrowing by a factor of 10(3). In addition, we find that certain anomalous contributions to the line shape, observed in previous low-field (250 mT) applications, are absent here.},

(S-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methyl methanesulfonothioate) (MTSL) was used as the spin label. The label position and dynamics were analyzed as was the impact of the modified DPPC on the structure of the surrounding lipids. The modified DPPC molecules locate closer to the center of the membrane than unmodified DPPC molecules. The rotation of the spin label is unrestricted, but there are favored orientations. MTSL depresses the deuterium order parameters of the carbon atoms close to the headgroup in surrounding DPPC molecules. The spin label has no impact on order parameters of carbon atoms at the end of the lipid tails. The lateral diffusion constant of the modified DPPC is indistinguishable from unmodified DPPC molecules. These novel computational results suggest an experimental validation.},

Eight different systems were considered: four at low and four at high peptide to lipid (P/L) ratios. In case of low P/L ratio we did not observe any pore creation in the bilayer. In two out of four of the simulations with the high P/L ratio, appearance of transient pores in the bilayer was observed. These pores were created due to an assembly of 3-5 melittin peptides. Not all of the peptides in the pores were in a transmembrane conformation; many of them had their termini residues anchored to the same leaflet, and these peptides assumed bent, U-shaped, conformations. We propose that when an assembly of melittin peptides creates pores, such an assembly acts as a "wedge" that splits the bilayer. To get a more detailed description of melittin on the bilayer surface and in transient pores, we performed coarse-grained to united-atom scale transformations and after that performed 50 ns molecular dynamics simulations using the united atom description of the systems. While these simulations did not show much of the change in the pore structure during the 50 ns time interval, they clearly showed the presence of water in the transient pores. The appearance of transient pores together with the translocation of peptides across the membranes is consistent with the mechanism proposed to explain graded dye leakage from large vesicles in the presence of melittin.},

The salt concentration was varied over a wide range from 0 to 5 M. We found that NaCl leads to a continuous swelling of the bilayers, whereas the behavior of the bilayer separation dW in the presence of CaCl2 is more complex, showing an initial large dW value, which decreased upon further addition of salt and finally increased again in the high concentration regime. This can be understood by a change of balance between electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. We were further able to show that both salts lead to a significant increase of order within the lipid bilayer, leading to a decrease of bilayer elasticity and shift of main phase transition temperature. This effect is more pronounced for Ca2+, and occurs mainly in the high salt-concentration regime. Thus, we were able to reconcile previous controversies between molecular dynamics simulations and x-ray diffraction experiments regarding the effect of salts on neutral lipid bilayers.},

  abstract = {The two-body Slowly Relaxing Local Structure (SRLS) model was applied to (15)N NMR spin relaxation in proteins and compared with the commonly used original and extended model-free (MF) approaches. In MF, the dynamic modes are assumed to be decoupled, local ordering at the N-H sites is represented by generalized order parameters, and internal motions are described by effective correlation times. SRLS accounts for dynamical coupling between the global diffusion of the protein and the internal motion of the N-H bond vector. The local ordering associated with the coupling potential and the internal N-H diffusion are tensors with orientations that may be tilted relative to the global diffusion and magnetic frames. SRLS generates spectral density functions that differ from the MF formulas. The MF spectral densities can be regarded as limiting cases of the SRLS spectral density. SRLS-based model-fitting and model-selection schemes similar to the currently used MF-based ones were devised, and a correspondence between analogous SRLS and model-free parameters was established. It was found that experimental NMR data are sensitive to the presence of mixed modes. Our results showed that MF can significantly overestimate order parameters and underestimate local motion correlation times in proteins. The extent of these digressions in the derived microdynamic parameters is estimated in the various parameter ranges, and correlated with the time scale separation between local and global motions. The SRLS-based analysis was tested extensively on (15)N relaxation data from several isotropically tumbling proteins. The results of SRLS-based fitting are illustrated with RNase H from E. coli, a protein extensively studied previously with MF.},

abstract = {The molecular motion of the phenalenyl (PNL) spin probe in the supercages of cation-exchanged X and Y zeolites (faujasites) has been physically characterized by pulsed and continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Both X and Y zeolites, whose cation sites were exchanged with the alkali metal ions, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ were examined. There is a good correspondence between the temperature dependences of the PNL electron spin phase memory time and the CW EPR spectra. Both display evidence of a thermal activation from a stationary, non-rotating molecular state to a low-temperature state of in-plane rotation (Das et al., Chem Phys. 143 (1990) 253). The rate of in-plane rotation is an activated process, with E*| / R=1289 |+- 35 K and 1462 +/- 47 K in NaX and KX zeolites, respectively. The rotation appears to be about an axis along which the half-filled, non-bonding [pi] orbital interacts with the exchanged cation in the supercage. Both CW and pulsed EPR also show a higher temperature activation from the in-plane rotating state to an effectively isoptropic state of rotation of PNL in which the PNL-cation bond is thought to be broken, with E*[perpendicular] / R=2050 +/- 110 K, 1956 +/- 46K, 1335 +/- 97 K in LiX, NaX and KX zeolites, respectively. The strength of the PNL-cation bonding decreases with increasing cation atomic number as indicated by E*[perpendicular] and the peripheral repulsion (crowding) of PNL increases with cation size as indicated E*|. There are qualitative indications that the binding of PNL to the cations in the Y zeolite is stronger than in the X zeolite.},

abstract = {Applications of angle-selected electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy using the vanadyl (VO 2+ ) cation or nitroxyl spin-labels as paramagnetic probes are reviewed in which structured solvent in small molecule and macromolecular complexes have been identified and characterized. By determination of the principal hyperfine (hf) coupling components (A) of magnetic nuclei in the vicinity of the paramagnetic probe, electron-nucleus distances are estimated according to the dipolar equation, and the relative coordinates of the nuclei are assigned on the basis of the orientation dependence of magnetic interactions. The precision in determining electron-nucleus distances over an approximate 3{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}8 {\{}{\AA}{\}} range for VO 2+ and 4{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}11 {\{}{\AA}{\}} range for spinlabels is generally S5{\%} based on ENDOR line widths and is exceeded only by that associated with X-ray diffraction of single crystals. The detailed structure of metal-bound or hydrogen-bonded solvent in small molecules, nucleotide complexes, and proteins in frozen glassy solutions is described. In particular, comparison of the structural details of solvent hydrogen-bonded to spin-labeled $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}-lactam antibiotics free in solution and sequestered in the active site of a spinlabeled penicilloyl acylenzyme reaction intermediate of TEM-1 $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}-lactamase is shown to bring improved understanding of the origin of the reactivity of $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}-lactam antibiotics and the mechanism of action of $\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}-lactamases.

  abstract = {ATP-dependent binding of the chaperonin GroEL to its cofactor GroES forms a cavity in which encapsulated substrate proteins can fold in isolation from bulk solution. It has been suggested that folding in the cavity may differ from that in bulk solution owing to steric confinement, interactions with the cavity walls, and differences between the properties of cavity-confined and bulk water. However, experimental data regarding the cavity-confined water are lacking. Here, we report measurements of water density and diffusion dynamics in the vicinity of a spin label attached to a cysteine in the Tyr71 → Cys GroES mutant obtained using two magnetic resonance techniques: electron-spin echo envelope modulation and Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization. Residue 71 in GroES is fully exposed to bulk water in free GroES and to confined water within the cavity of the GroEL-GroES complex. Our data show that water density and translational dynamics in the vicinity of the label do not change upon complex formation, thus indicating that bulk water-exposed and cavity-confined GroES surface water share similar properties. Interestingly, the diffusion dynamics of water near the GroES surface are found to be unusually fast relative to other protein surfaces studied. The implications of these findings for chaperonin-assisted folding mechanisms are discussed.},

  abstract   = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f∈CN and a randomly chosen set of frequencies $\Omega$. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set $\Omega$? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=$\sigma$$\tau$∈Tf($\tau$)$\delta$(t-$\tau$) obeying |T|≤CM{\textperiodcentered}(log N)-1 {\textperiodcentered} |$\Omega$| for some constant CM{\textgreater}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N-M), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ℓ1 minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for CM which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|{\textperiodcentered}logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|{\textperiodcentered}logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

The latest crystal structural data of PSII have enabled detailed analyses of the location and possible function of water molecules in the enzyme. Significant progress has also been made recently in the investigation of channels and pathways through the protein complex. Through these studies, the mechanistic significance of water for PSII is becoming increasingly clear. An overview and discussion of key aspects of the current research on water in PSII is presented here. The role of water in three other systems (aquaporin, bacteriorhodopsin and cytochrome P450) is also outlined to illustrate further points concerning the central significance that water can have, and potential applications of these ideas for continued research on PSII. It is advocated that water be seen as an integral part of the protein and far from a mere solvent.},

abstract = {The protein chemical shifts holds a large amount of information about the 3-dimensional structure of the protein. A number of chemical shift predictors based on the relationship between structures resolved with X-ray crystallography and the corresponding experimental chemical shifts have been developed. These empirical predictors are very accurate on X-ray structures but tends to be insensitive to small structural changes. To overcome this limitation it has been suggested to make chemical shift predictors based on quantum mechanical(QM) calculations. In this thesis the development of the QM derived chemical shift predictor Procs14 is presented. Procs14 is based on 2.35 million density functional theory(DFT) calculations on tripeptides and contains corrections for hydrogen bonding, ring current and the effect of the previous and following residue. Procs14 is capable at performing predictions for the 13CA, 13CB, 13CO, 15NH, 1HN and 1HA backbone atoms. In order to benchmark Procs14, a number of QM NMR calculations are performed on full protein structures. Of the tested empirical and QM derived predictors, Procs14 reproduced the QM chemical shifts with the highest accuracy. A comparison with the QM derived predictor CheShift-2 on X-ray structures and NMR ensembles with experimental chemical shift data, showed that Procs14 predicted the chemical shifts with the best accuracy. The predictions on the NMR ensembles exhibited the best performance. This suggests that future work might benefit from using ensemble sampling when performing simulations of protein folding with chemical shifts. Procs14 is implemented in the markov chain monte carlo protein folding framework PHAISTOS. The computational efficient implementation of Procs14 allows for rapid predictions and therefore potential use in refinement and folding of protein structures.},

  abstract = {Hydration water is vital for various macromolecular biological activities, such as specific ligand recognition, enzyme activity, response to receptor binding, and energy transduction. Without hydration water, proteins would not fold correctly and would lack the conformational flexibility that animates their three-dimensional structures. Motions in globular, soluble proteins are thought to be governed to a certain extent by hydration-water dynamics, yet it is not known whether this relationship holds true for other protein classes in general and whether, in turn, the structural nature of a protein also influences water motions. Here, we provide insight into the coupling between hydration-water dynamics and atomic motions in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP), a largely unexplored class of proteins that, in contrast to folded proteins, lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. We investigated the human IDP tau, which is involved in the pathogenic processes accompanying Alzheimer disease. Combining neutron scattering and protein perdeuteration, we found similar atomic mean-square displacements over a large temperature range for the tau protein and its hydration water, indicating intimate coupling between them. This is in contrast to the behavior of folded proteins of similar molecular weight, such as the globular, soluble maltose-binding protein and the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, which display moderate to weak coupling, respectively. The extracted mean square displacements also reveal a greater motional flexibility of IDP compared with globular, folded proteins and more restricted water motions on the IDP surface. The results provide evidence that protein and hydration-water motions mutually affect and shape each other, and that there is a gradient of coupling across different protein classes that may play a functional role in macromolecular activity in a cellular context.},

  abstract = {Knowing the topology and location of protein segments at water-membrane interfaces is critical for rationalizing their functions, but their characterization is challenging under physiological conditions. Here, we debut a unique spectroscopic approach by using the hydration dynamics gradient found across the phospholipid bilayer as an intrinsic ruler for determining the topology, immersion depth, and orientation of protein segments in lipid membranes, particularly at water-membrane interfaces. This is achieved through the site-specific quantification of translational diffusion of hydration water using an emerging tool, (1)H Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP)-enhanced NMR relaxometry. ODNP confirms that the membrane-bound region of $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$S), an amyloid protein known to insert an amphipathic $\alpha$-helix into negatively charged phospholipid membranes, forms an extended $\alpha$-helix parallel to the membrane surface. We extend the current knowledge by showing that residues 90-96 of bound $\alpha$S, which is a transition segment that links the $\alpha$-helix and the C terminus, adopt a larger loop than an idealized $\alpha$-helix. The unstructured C terminus gradually threads through the surface hydration layers of lipid membranes, with the beginning portion residing within 5-15 {\AA} above the phosphate level, and only the very end of C terminus surveying bulk water. Remarkably, the intrinsic hydration dynamics gradient along the bilayer normal extends to 20-30 {\AA} above the phosphate level, as demonstrated with a peripheral membrane protein, annexin B12. ODNP offers the opportunity to reveal previously unresolvable structure and location of protein segments well above the lipid phosphate, whose structure and dynamics critically contribute to the understanding of functional versatility of membrane proteins.},

In this paper, we report low beam power and high-efficiency operation of a tunable gyrotron oscillator at 233 GHz. The low-voltage operating mode provides a path to further miniaturization of the gyrotron through reduction in the size of the electron gun, power supply, collector, and cooling system, which will benefit industrial and scientific applications requiring portability. Detailed studies of low-voltage operation in the TE2,3,1 mode reveal that the mode can be excited with less than 7 W of beam power at 3.5 kV. During CW operation with 3.5-kV beam voltage and 50-mA beam current, the gyrotron generates 12 W of RF power at 233.2 GHz. The EGUN electron optics code describes the low-voltage operation of the electron gun. Using gun-operating parameters derived from EGUN simulations, we show that a linear theory adequately predicts the low experimental starting currents.},

The process is feasible because the newest generation probe requires only small amounts of protein, typically 30-200 microg in 8-35 microl volume. Extensive automation has been made possible by the combination of database tools, mechanization of key process steps, and the use of a micro-cryoprobe that gives excellent data while requiring little optimization and manual setup. In this perspective, we describe the overall process used by the NESG for screening NMR samples as part of a sample optimization process, assessing optimal construct design and solution conditions, as well as for determining protein rotational correlation times in order to assess protein oligomerization states. Database infrastructure has been developed to allow for flexible implementation of new screening protocols and harvesting of the resulting output. The NESG micro NMR screening pipeline has also been used for detergent screening of membrane proteins. Descriptions of the individual steps in the NESG NMR sample design, production, and screening pipeline are presented in the format of a standard operating procedure.},

  abstract  = {Detailed mechanisms for substrate water exchange in the oxygen evolving complex in photosystem II have been determined with DFT methods for large models. Existing interpretations of the experimental water exchange results have been quite different. By many groups, these results have been the main argument against the water oxidation mechanism suggested by DFT, in which the oxygen molecule is formed between a bridging oxo and an oxyl radical ligand in the center of the OEC. That mechanism is otherwise in line with most experiments. The problem has been that the mechanism requires a rather fast exchange of a bridging oxo ligand, which is not a common finding for smaller Mn-containing model systems. However, other groups have actually favored a substrate derived oxo ligand partly based on the same experiments. In the present study, three S-states have been studied, and the rates have been well reproduced by the calculations. The surprising experimental finding that water exchange in S1 is slower than the one in S2 is reproduced and explained. The key to this rate difference is the ease by which one of the manganese centers (Mn3) is reduced. This reduction has to occur to release the substrate water from Mn3. The similar rate of the slow exchange in S2 and S3 has been rationalized on the basis of earlier experiments combined with the present calculations. The results strongly support the previous DFT-suggested water oxidation mechanism.},

The considerable enhancement this experiment provides for extracting rotational and translational diffusion rates, as well as orientational ordering parameters by means of ESR spectroscopy, is demonstrated. The 2D spectral analysis is achieved using theoretical simulations that are fit to experiments by an efficient and automated nonlinear least squares approach. These methods are applied to dispersions of 1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (POPC) model membranes utilizing spin labels 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidylcholine and the 3-doxyl derivative of cholestan-3-one (CSL). Generally favorable agreement is obtained between the results obtained by 2D-FT-ESR on vesicles with the previous results on similar systems studied by continuous wave (cw) ESR on aligned samples. The precision in determining the dynamic and ordering parameters is significantly better for 2D-FT-ESR, even though the cw ESR spectra from membrane vesicles are resolved more poorly than those from well aligned samples. Some small differences in results by the two methods are discussed in terms of limitations of the methods and/or theoretical models, as well as possible differences between dynamic molecular structure in vesicles versus aligned membranes. An interesting observation with CSL/POPC, that the apparent homogeneous linewidths seem to increase in "real time," is tentatively attributed to the effects of slow director fluctuations in the membrane vesicles.},

Despite the critical importance of fibrin deformability for outcomes of bleeding and thrombosis, the structural origins of the clot's elasticity and plasticity remain largely unknown. However, there is substantial evidence that unfolding of fibrin is an important part of the mechanism. We used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to reveal force-induced changes in the secondary structure of hydrated fibrin clots made of human blood plasma in vitro. When extended or compressed, fibrin showed a shift of absorbance intensity mainly in the amide I band (1600-1700 cm(-1)) as well as in the amide II and III bands, indicating an increase of the beta-sheets and a corresponding reduction of the alpha-helices. The structural conversions correlated directly with the strain or pressure and were partially reversible at the conditions applied. The additional absorbance observed at 1612-1624 cm(-1) was characteristic of the nascent interchain beta-sheets, consistent with protein aggregation and fiber bundling during clot deformation observed using scanning electron microscopy. We conclude that under extension and/or compression an alpha-helix to beta-sheet conversion of the coiled-coils occurs in the fibrin clot as a part of forced protein unfolding.},

  abstract = {The interaction between nuclear and electronic spins is of interest for structural characterization of biomolecules and biomedical imaging based on nuclear magnetic resonance. The polarization of the nuclear spins can be increased significantly if the electron spin polarization is kept out of equilibrium. We employ semiclassical relaxation theory to analyze the electronic polarization of the two-spin system characteristic of nitroxide radicals. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the nitroxide TEMPOL in water are performed to account for the effects of tumbling and spin-rotation coupling on the spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times. Concentration effects on the electron saturation are introduced by allowing for Heisenberg spin exchange between two nitroxides. Polarization enhancement profiles, calculated from the computed saturation, are directly compared with liquid-state dynamic nuclear polarization experiments conducted at 260 GHz/400 MHz. The contribution of the separate hyperfine lines to the saturation can be easily disentangled using the developed formalism.},

They are involved in a no. of biol. functions such as sperm motility and immunomodulation by seminal plasma. The aim of our study was to investigate whether prostasomes play a role in the antioxidant status of seminal plasma. In cell suspensions obtained after elimination of seminal plasma by centrifugation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) as measured by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence were mainly produced by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). The addn. of prostasomes to these cell suspensions lowered the overall ROS prodn. in the basal state and after stimulation with phorbol ester. This action could not be explained by a ROS-scavenging capacity of the prostasomes, as demonstrated by their inability to scavenge ROS produced by 2,2'-azobis-2-amidinopropane dihydrochloride. Using ESR, we could assess the influence of prostasomes on the plasma membranes of blood PMN and show that it was characterized by an increase in the correlation-relaxation time of the probe 16-doxyl-stearic acid inserted in the membranes. Thus, prostasomes caused a rigidification of blood PMN membranes. These results strongly suggest that the effect of prostasomes in semen could result from their interaction with PMN.

Therefore, we experimentally validate here spin-counting via 4-pulse electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) on well-defined test samples. Two biradicals, a symmetric and an asymmetric triradical, and a tetraradical were synthesized in a convergent reaction scheme via palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. PELDOR was then used to obtain geometric information and the number of spin centers per molecule in a single experiment. The measurement yielded the expected distances (2.2-3.8 nm) and showed that different spin-spin distances in one molecule can be resolved even if the difference amounts to only 5 A. The number of spins n has been determined to be 2.1 in both biradicals, to 3.1 and 3.0 in the symmetric and asymmetric triradicals, respectively, and to 3.9 in the tetraradical. The overall error of PELDOR spin-counting was found to be 5{\%} for up to four spins. Thus, this method is a valuable tool to determine the number of constituting spin-bearing monomers in biologically relevant homo- and heterooligomers and how their oligomerization state and geometric arrangement changes during function.},

This approach is found to successfully reproduce the experimental spectra, rotational anisotropy decays, and spectral diffusion time-correlation functions as a function of micelle size. These results are interpreted in terms of water molecules in different hydrogen bonding environments. One interesting result from our simulation, not directly accessible experimentally, involves the distance from the surfactant headgroup/water interface over which the dynamical properties of water become bulk-like. We find that this distance varies with micelle size, casting doubt on the core/shell model. In particular, the distance increases with decreasing micelle size, and hence decreasing radius of curvature of the interface. We suggest that this arises from curvature-induced frustration. We also find that the dynamics in the smallest micelle studied is extremely slow--relaxation is still incomplete by 1 ns. As in other glassy systems with collective relaxation, our time-correlation functions can be fit to stretched exponentials, in this case with very small exponents.},

Thereby, the required microwave peak power is reduced by a factor of tau(p)/T1 as compared to equivalent pulsed FT EPR in which the spin system with spin-lattice relaxation time T1 is excited by a single microwave pulse of length tau(p). Stochastic EPR is particularly interesting under high-field/high-frequency conditions, because the limited output power of mm microwave sources, amplifiers, and mixers makes pulse FT EPR in that frequency domain impossible, at least for the near future. On the other hand, FT spectroscopy offers several advantages compared to field-swept magnetic resonance methods, as is demonstrated by its success in NMR and X-band EPR. In this paper we describe a novel stochastic W-band microwave bridge including a bimodal induction mode transmission resonator that serves for decoupling the microwave excitation and signal detection. We report first EPR measurements and discuss experimental difficulties as well as achieved sensitivity. Moreover, we discuss future improvements and the possibility for an application of stochastic W-band FT EPR to transient signals such as those of photoexcited radical pairs in photosynthetic reaction centers.},

Here, a method based on the technique of site-directed spin labeling was developed to experimentally map shapes of two DNA duplexes that contain response elements of the p53 tumor suppressor. An R5a nitroxide spin label, which was covalently attached at a specific phosphate group, was scanned consecutively through the DNA duplex. X-band continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor rotational motions of R5a, which report on DNA structure and dynamics at the labeling site. An approach based on Pearson's coefficient analysis was developed to collectively examine the degree of similarity among the ensemble of R5a spectra. The resulting Pearson's coefficients were used to generate maps representing variation of R5a mobility along the DNA duplex. The R5a mobility maps were found to correlate with maps of certain DNA helical parameters, and were capable of revealing similarity and deviation in the shape of the two closely related DNA duplexes. Collectively, the R5a probe and the Pearson's coefficient-based lineshape analysis scheme yielded a generalizable method for examining sequence-dependent DNA shapes.},

The importance of analyzing  the data in Fourier space is emphasized, and a new method which enables  the determination of the important Fourier modes while also providing a  test of the reliability of the measurement of the diffusion coefficient,  Dx, is presented. It is shown that values of Dx ∼ 10−9 cm−2 s−1 can be  measured in about one hour to 10–20{\%} accuracy, whereas for Dx ∼ 10−7 cm2  s−1 the error should be below 1{\%}. These statements are applicable for  experiments in which there is unrestricted diffusion, and an initial  Gaussian concentration profile. Systematic error resulting from  non-Gaussian concentration profiles is shown to be relatively  unimportant. However, the finite sweep time through a spectrum is found  to yield a systematic error analogous to a Doppler shift, which tends to  cancel only for the case of unrestricted diffusion. The experimental  geometry in which there is diffusion from a reflective boundary requires  special adjustments to align the gradient-on and -off spectra. A  convenient and reliable method to accomplish this is presented.  Nevertheless, there are inherently greater sources of error for this  geometry, and this is confirmed by the experimental results. Utilizing  the reflective boundary geometry, the longitudinal and transverse  diffusion coefficients for PD-TEMPONE (15N labeled) in the nematic phase  of MBBA at 20°C are 3.7 × 10−7 and 2.5 × 10−7 cm2 s−1, respectively.  Their ratio of 1.5 is consistent with results for other probe molecules  in MBBA.},

Phys. 48, 329 (1983); Nilsson and Kowalewski, J. Magn. Reson. 146, 345 (2000)] for inner-sphere relaxation. It is demonstrated that the outer-sphere relaxation rate can be expressed as an integral of a product of a translational diffusion correlation function and a function analogous to the inner-sphere spectral density. A numerical implementation of the theory is described and applied to a large number of realistic parameter sets for S = 7/2 and S = 1, which may correspond to Gd(III) and Ni(II) systems. It is shown that the outer-sphere contribution is relevant and should be included into the analysis of nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion relaxation profiles, especially for slow relative translational diffusion and fast molecular tumbling.},

  abstract      = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin trapping were used for detection of free radical reactions utilizing a new fluorinated analog of DMPO, 4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethyl-2-trifluoromethylpyrroline-1-oxide (FDMPO). The parent FDMPO spin trap exhibits a single F-19-NMR resonance at -66.0 ppm. The signal to noise ratio improved 10.4-fold compared to P-31-NMR sensitivity of the phosphorus-containing spin trap, DEPMPO. The spin adducts of FDMPO with (OH)-O-., (CH3)-C-., and (CH2OH)-C-. were characterized. Competitive spin trapping of FDMPO with DMPO showed that both have similar rates of addition of (OH)-O-. and C-centered radicals. The corresponding paramagnetic spin adducts of FDMPO were extremely stable to degradation. In the presence of ascorbate, reaction products from C-centered radicals resulted in the appearance of two additional F-19-NMR signals at -78.6 and -80 ppm for FDMPO/(CH3)-C-. and at -74.6 and -76.75 ppm for FDMPO/(CH2OH)-C-.. In each case, these peaks were assigned to the two stereoisomers of their respective, reduced hydroxylamines. The identification of the hydroxylamines for FDMPO/(CH3)-C-. was confirmed by EPR and F-19-NMR spectra of independently synthesized samples. In summary, spin adducts of FDMPO were highly stable for ESR. For NMR spin trapping, FDMPO showed improved signal to noise and similar spin trapping efficiency compared to DEPMPO.

  abstract = {This paper, the first in a series on optimization of T1 measurements, describes the mathematical procedures for the analysis. Detailed results are presented in papers to follow. We assume here that a least-squares analysis is used to process magnetization data and that a first-order analysis is sufficient for practical values of the signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast to earlier analyses, we assume an initial uncertainty in the a priori knowledge of T1, specifically that T1 is known to be between TA and TB. We then calculate , i.e., the dimensionless standard deviation of the estimate of T1. The optimum set of measurement times $\tau$1, $\tau$2, {\ldots}, $\tau$3., is then defined to be that which minimizes the maximum of for T1 in the interval (TA, TB). The overall objective is that of obtaining maximum precision in the shortest time. We show how to calculate the optimum number of experiments required to achieve a specified precision and how to calculate the associated total spectrometer time. Finally, we calculate $\sigma$(T1)/T1, for experiments in which separate measurements are made of the equilibrium magnetization, M(∞).},

Potentiometric studies show an increased stability of the Gd(III) complex of H(3)bpatcn (logK(GdL)=15.8(2)) with respect to the Gd(III) complex of the analogous ligand 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N',N''-triacetic acid (H(3)nota) (logK(GdL)=13.7), associated with an increased selectivity of H(3)bpatcn for gadolinium over calcium. The H(3)bpatcn ligand sensitises the terbium ion very efficiently, leading to a long-lived and highly luminescent terbium complex (quantum yield=43 {\%}), in spite of the presence of a coordinated water molecule. (1)H proton NMR studies indicate that the metal ion is rigidly encapsulated by the three arms of the octadentate ligand H(3)bpatcn and that the macrocycle framework remains bound (through the five nitrogen and the three oxygen atoms) even at high temperature. A new theoretical method for interpreting the water proton relaxivity is presented. It is based on recent progresses in the description of the electronic spin relaxation and on an auxiliary probe solute. It replaces the Solomon, Bloembergen and Morgan (SBM) framework, which is questionable at low field, while avoiding resorting to simulations and/or sophisticated theories with additional unknown zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters. The inclusion of two picolinate groups on a triazacyclononane framework affords the mono-aquo gadolinium complex [Gd(bpatcn)(H(2)O)] with favourable electron-relaxation properties (tau(eff)(S0)=125 ps). The optimisation of the electronic relaxation by ligand design is especially important to achieve high relaxivity in the new generation macromolecular complexes with long rotational correlation times.},

  abstract  = {Water plays a central role in the structures and properties of biomolecules--proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes--and in their interactions with ligands and drugs. Over the past half century, our understanding of water has been advanced significantly owing to theoretical and computational modeling. However, like the blind men and the elephant, different models describe different aspects of water's behavior. The trend in water modeling has been toward finer-scale properties and increasing structural detail, at increasing computational expense. Recently, our labs and others have moved in the opposite direction, toward simpler physical models, focusing on more global properties-water's thermodynamics, phase diagram, and solvation properties, for example-and toward less computational expense. Simplified models can guide a better understanding of water in ways that complement what we learn from more complex models. One ultimate goal is more tractable models for computer simulations of biomolecules. This review gives a perspective from simple models on how the physical properties of water-as a pure liquid and as a solvent-derive from the geometric and hydrogen bonding properties of water.},

The sensor is composed of two half-wavelength microstrip line resonators, designed to match the 50 Omega impedance of the lines on a high dielectric constant GaAs substrate. The line resonators cross each other perpendicularly through their centers, forming a cross. Microstrip feed lines are coupled through small gaps to three arms of the cross to connect the resonator to the excitation ports. The control of the relative magnitude and phase between the two microwave stimuli at the input ports of each line allows for tuning the degree and type of polarization of the microwave excitation at the center of the cross resonator. The third (output) port is used to measure the transmitted signal, which is crucial to work at low temperatures, where reflections along lengthy coaxial lines mask the signal reflected by the resonator. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra recorded at low temperature in an S=5/2 molecular magnet system show that 82{\%} fidelity circular polarization of the microwaves is achieved over the central area of the resonator.},

abstract = {Biology relies on functional interplay of proteins in the crowded and heterogeneous environment inside cells, and functional protein interactions are often weak and transient. Thus, methods that preserve these interactions and provide information about them are needed. In-cell nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an attractive method for studying a protein's behavior in cells because it may provide residue-level structural and dynamic information, yet several factors limit the feasibility of protein NMR spectroscopy in cells; among them, slow rotational diffusion has emerged as the most important. In this paper, we seek to elucidate the causes of the dramatically slow protein tumbling in cells and in so doing to gain insight into how the intracellular viscosity and weak, transient interactions modulate protein mobility. To address these questions, we characterized the rotational diffusion of three model globular proteins in Escherichia coli cells using two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. These proteins have a similar molecular size and globular fold but very different surface properties, and indeed, they show very different rotational diffusion in the E. coli intracellular environment. Our data are consistent with an intracellular viscosity approximately 8 times that of water, too low to be a limiting factor for observation of small globular proteins by in-cell NMR spectroscopy. Thus, we conclude that transient interactions with cytoplasmic components significantly and differentially affect the mobility of proteins and therefore their NMR detectability. Moreover, we suggest that an intricate interplay of total protein charge and hydrophobic interactions plays a key role in regulating these weak intermolecular interactions in cells.},

The recombinant apoprotein, denatured in dodecyl sulfate, spontaneously folds when it is mixed with its pigments, chlorophylls, and carotenoids in detergent solution, and assembles into structurally authentic LHCII in the course of several minutes. Pulse EPR techniques, specifically double-electron-electron resonance (DEER), have been used to analyze protein folding during this process. Pairs of nitroxide labels were introduced site-specifically into recombinant LHCII and shown not to affect the stability and function of the pigment-protein complex. Interspin distance distributions between two spin pairs were measured at various time points, one pair located on either end of the second transmembrane helix (helix 3), the other one located near the luminal ends of the intertwined transmembrane helices 1 and 4. In the dodecyl sulfate-solubilized apoprotein, both distance distributions were consistent with a random-coil protein structure. A rapid freeze-quench experiment on the latter spin pair indicated that 1 s after initiating reconstitution the protein structure is virtually unchanged. Subsequently, both distance distributions monitored protein folding in the same time range in which the assembly of chlorophylls into the complex had been observed. The positioning of the spin pair spanning the hydrophobic core of LHCII clearly preceded the juxtaposition of the spin pair on the luminal side of the complex. This indicates that superhelix formation of helices 1 and 4 is a late step in LHCII assembly.},

  abstract = {A technique that is increasingly being used to determine the structure and conformational flexibility of biomacromolecules is Pulsed Electron-Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR or DEER), an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) based technique. At X-band frequencies (9.5 GHz), PELDOR is capable of precisely measuring distances in the range of 1.5-8 nm between paramagnetic centres but the orientation selectivity is weak. In contrast, working at higher frequencies increases the orientation selection but usually at the expense of decreased microwave power and PELDOR modulation depth. Here it is shown that a home-built high-power pulsed W-band EPR spectrometer (HiPER) with a large instantaneous bandwidth enables one to achieve PELDOR data with a high degree of orientation selectivity and large modulation depths. We demonstrate a measurement methodology that gives a set of PELDOR time traces that yield highly constrained data sets. Simulating the resulting time traces provides a deeper insight into the conformational flexibility and exchange coupling of three bisnitroxide model systems. These measurements provide strong evidence that W-band PELDOR may prove to be an accurate and quantitative tool in assessing the relative orientations of nitroxide spin labels and to correlate those orientations to the underlying biological structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {An understanding of macromolecular conformational equilibrium in biological systems is oftentimes essential to understand function, dysfunction, and disease. For the past few years, our lab has been utilizing site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to characterize the conformational ensemble and ligand-induced conformational shifts of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR). The biomedical importance of characterizing the fractional occupancy of states within the conformational ensemble critically impacts our hypothesis of a conformational selection mechanism of drug-resistance evolution in HIV-1PR. The purpose of the following chapter is to give a timeline perspective of our SDSL EPR approach to characterizing conformational sampling of HIV-1PR. We provide detailed instructions for the procedure utilized in analyzing distance profiles for HIV-1PR obtained from pulsed electron–electron double resonance (PELDOR). Specifically, we employ a version of PELDOR known as double electron–electron resonance (DEER). Data are processed with the software package “DeerAnalysis” (http://www.epr.ethz.ch/software), which implements Tikhonov regularization (TKR), to generate a distance profile from electron spin-echo amplitude modulations. We assign meaning to resultant distance profiles based upon a conformational sampling model, which is described herein. The TKR distance profiles are reconstructed with a linear combination of Gaussian functions, which is then statistically analyzed. In general, DEER has proven powerful for observing structural ensembles in proteins and, more recently, nucleic acids. Our goal is to present our advances in order to aid readers in similar applications.},

This allows accommodating a large flat sample above the resonator in addition to having variable coupling properties. Such resonators have a very small volume which, compared to previous designs, improves their absolute spin sensitivity by a factor of more than 2 (based on experimental results). They also have a very high microwave field-power conversion ratio of up to 86 gauss/√Hz. This could facilitate the use of very short excitation pulses with relatively low microwave power. Following the presentation and the discussion of the experimental results, ways to further increase sensitivity significantly are outlined.},

Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used. Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials. The time constants contain various combinations of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) for both isotopes, Heisenberg exchange rates, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times (T1n). Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants. The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that (i) the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number, (ii) relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition, (iii) the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length, (iv) T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration, and (v) Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration. It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here. The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spin-lattice relaxation probabilities.},

A uniform proton T-1 is generally assumed for the entire region of interest for the computation of PO2 using OMRI. It is demonstrated here, by both phantom and in vivo (mice) imaging, that such an assumption may cause erroneous estimate of PO2. A direct estimate of pixel-wise T-1 is hampered by the poor native MR intensities, owing to the very low Zeeman field (15-20 mT) in OMRI. To circumvent this problem, a simple method for the pixel-wise mapping of proton T-1 using the OMRI scanner is described. A proton T-1 image of a slice through the center of an SCC tumor in a mouse clearly shows a range of T-1 distribution (0.2 similar to 1.6 s). Computation of PO2 images using pixel-wise T-1 values promises oximetry with minimal artifacts by OMRI. Published 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A novel technique to measure the broad band frequency dependent real and imaginary parts of the relative permittivity is described. The basic experimental configuration and numerical data analysis are reported along with a discussion of several difficulties encountered and experimental validation of the method. The preliminary results show a strong dependence of the dielectric constant of the Nafion{\textregistered} 117 membrane with water content. The dielectric constant for all hydrated membrane samples was observed to be constant over the initial part of the frequency span, ranging from a maximum of 20 in the samples with 13 waters per sulfonate to a minimum of four in very dry samples. The results reflect the decreasing polar environment of the water at low water contents as well as the increasing extent of binding of the water at the fixed ionic site at low water content. A ‘roll off' in the dielectric constant, the extent of which was dependent on water content, was observed also in the frequency spectrum. Several possible origins for this ‘roll-off', including real effects of dipolar relaxations occurring in the hydrated polymers and experimental effects due to the similarity of the wavelength of radiation to the sample dimensions are discussed. Finally, the conductivity of the membranes at various water contents and at frequencies below 5 GHz was extracted from the loss factor spectra. These values agreed well with previous conductivity measurements (obtained at lower frequencies) suggesting that no relaxations are observed in the intervening frequency range (roughly 5–50 MHz).},

In particular, time dependence disappears from the background Hamiltonian (sample spinning is treated as an interaction), spherical quadrature grids are avoided completely (coordinate distributions are a part of the formalism) and relaxation theory with any linear diffusion operator is easily adopted from the Stochastic Liouville Equation theory. The proposed formalism contains Floquet theory as a special case. The elimination of the spherical averaging grid comes at the cost of increased matrix dimensions, but we show that this can be mitigated by the use of state space restriction and tensor train techniques. It is also demonstrated that low correlation order basis sets apparently give accurate answers in powder-averaged MAS simulations, meaning that polynomially scaling simulation algorithms do exist for a large class of solid state NMR experiments.},

  abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling provides a means for exploring structure and dynamics in proteins. To interpret the complex EPR spectra that often arise, it is necessary to characterize the rotamers of the spin-labeled side chain and the interactions they make with the local environment in proteins of known structure. For this purpose, crystal structures have been determined for T4 lysozyme bearing a nitroxide side chain (R1) at the solvent-exposed helical sites 41 and 44 in the B helix. These sites are of particular interest in that the corresponding EPR spectra reveal two dynamic states of R1, one of which is relatively immobilized suggesting interactions of the nitroxide with the environment. The crystal structures together with the effect of mutagenesis of nearest neighbors on the motion of R1 suggest intrahelical interactions of 41R1 with the i + 4 residue and of 44R1 with the i + 1 residue. Such interactions appear to be specific to particular rotamers of the R1 side chain.},

Conventionally, the elastic line and the broad wings are treated as separate phenomena. We show that there is no separation; the entire spectrum consists of Lorentzians with the natural line width. In protein crystals, the shifts of the individual lines from the elastic center above about 150 K are caused by beta fluctuations in the hydration shell. Vibrations cause shifts in the entire temperature range but are best seen below about 150 K. We construct a microscopic model for the dynamics that is based on a random walk of the proteins in their free-energy landscape. The model yields approximate values for the steps in the energy landscape. Remarkably, the quantum electrodynamic concept of gamma rays is needed to justify the model.},

  abstract  = {Neutron scattering techniques represent a powerful tool for characterizing both the structure and dynamical properties of bio-systems, for example, proteins and membranes interacting with their solvents. In this paper, Elastic Neutron Scattering (ENS) data collected at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France) on dry and D2O hydrated lysozyme by varying hydration level are presented, and compared with previously published data on the same protein system, also with the addition of bio-protectants. The data have been collected with three different spectrometers, i.e. IN13, IN10 and IN4. This set of ENS data gives direct access to the temperature behavior of both (i) the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) and (ii) the characteristic system relaxation time. As a result, an explicative hypothesis on the relationship between the so-called "protein dynamical transition" (PDT) and the "fragile-to-strong dynamical crossover" (FSC) is formulated. Furthermore, by taking into proper account the effect of the finite instrumental energy resolution of the used spectrometers, the vibrational MSD of dry and hydrated lysozyme is calculated. The vibrational MSD of the lysozyme in the dry state resulted to be higher than the one in the hydrated state; the latter reaches the former at a temperature value of T=220K that corresponds to the temperature at which the FSC occurs. As a result, a cage effect resulting from the hydration water on the protein surface is hypothesized and subsequently linked to the FSC.},

abstract = {The reaction center of photosystem II (PSII) of the oxygenic photosynthetic electron transport chain contains two redox-active tyrosines, Tyr160 (YD) of the D2 polypeptide and Tyr161 (YZ) of the D1 polypeptide, each of which may be oxidized by the primary electron donor, P680+. Spectroscopic characterization of YZ. has been hampered by the simultaneous presence of the much more stable YD., the short lifetime of YZ., and the difficulty in trapping the YZ. radical at low temperature. We present here a method for obtaining an uncontaminated YZ. radical, trapped by freezing under illumination of PSII core complexes isolated from YD-less mutants of Synechocystis 6803. Specific labeling with deuterium of the beta-methylene-3,3- or of the ring 3,5-protons of the PSII reaction center tyrosines in the YD-less D2-Tyr160Phe mutant results in a change in the hyperfine structure of the YZ. EPR signal, further confirming that this signal indeed arises from tyrosine. The trapped YZ. radical is also stable for several months at liquid nitrogen temperature. Due to both the absence of contaminating paramagnetic species and the stability at low temperature of YZ., this mutant core complex constitutes an excellent experimental system for the spectroscopic analysis of YZ.. We have compared the environments of YZ. and YD. by EPR, 1H ENDOR, and TRIPLE spectroscopies using both mutant and wild-type core complexes, with the following observations: (1) the EPR spectra of YZ. and YD. differ in line shape and line width. (2) Both YZ. and YD. exhibit D2O-exchangeable 1H hyperfine coupling near 3 MHz, consistent with the presence of a hydrogen bond from a proton donor to the phenolic oxygen atom of a neutral tyrosyl radical. This hyperfine coupling is sharp in the case of YD., indicating the hydrogen bond to be well-defined. In the case of YZ. it is broad, suggestive of a distribution of hydrogen-bonding distances. (3) YD. possesses three additional weak couplings that disappear in D2O, arising from three or fewer protons (protein or solvent) located within a shell between 4.5 and 8.5 A. (4) All of the 1H couplings of YD. are sharp, which is indicative of a well-ordered protein environment. (5) All of the 1H couplings in the YZ. spectrum are broad. The environment surrounding YZ. appears to be more disordered and solvent-accessible.},

Carrier drift and extraction dynamics are strongly stoichiometry-dependent: the speed of electron or hole drift increases with higher concentration of PC61BM or poly-mer, respectively. The electron extraction from a sample with 80{\%} PC61BM takes place during hundreds of picoseconds, but slows down to sub-microseconds in a sample with 33{\%} PC61BM. The hole extraction is less stoichiometry depend-ent - it varies form sub-nanoseconds to tens of nanoseconds when the PC61BM concentration changes from 33{\%} to 80{\%}. The electron extraction rate correlates with the conversion efficiency of solar cells, leading to the conclusion that fast electron motion is essential for efficient charge carrier separation preventing their geminate recombination.},

  abstract  = {Lipid-protein interactions are an important determinant of the stability and function of integral and transmembrane proteins. In addition to local interactions at the lipid-protein interface, global interactions such as the distribution of internal lateral pressure may also influence protein conformation. It is shown here that the effects of the membrane lateral pressure profile on the conformation or insertion of proteins in membranes are equivalent to the elastic response to the frustrated spontaneous curvature, c(o), of the component lipid monolayer leaflets. The chemical potential of the protein in the membrane is predicted to depend linearly on the spontaneous curvature of the lipid leaflets, just as does the contribution of the protein to the elastic bending energy of the lipid, and to be independent of the hydrophobic tension, gamma(phob), at the lipid-water interface. Analysis of the dependence of protein partitioning or conformational transitions on spontaneous curvature of the constituent lipids gives an experimental estimate for the cross-sectional intramembrane shape of the protein or its difference between conformations. Values in the region of 50-110 A(2) are estimated for the effective cross-sectional shape changes on the insertion and conductance transitions of alamethicin, and on the activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase or rhodopsin in lipid membranes. Much larger values are estimated for the mechanosensitive channel, MscL. Values for the change in intramembrane shape may also be used, together with determinations of lipid relative association constants, to estimate contributions of direct lipid-protein interactions to the lateral pressure experienced by the protein. Changes in chemical potential approximately 12 kJ mol(-1) can be estimated for radial changes of 1 A in a protein of diameter 40 A.},

  abstract = {Diffusion in porous media is a general subject that involves many fields of research, such as chemistry (e.g. porous catalytic pallets), biology (e.g. porous cellular organelles), and materials science (e.g. porous polymer matrixes for controlled-release and gas-storage materials). Pulsed-gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance (PGSE NMR) is a powerful technique that is often employed to characterize complex diffusion patterns inside porous media. Typically it measures the motion of at least approximately 10(15) molecules occurring in the milliseconds-to-seconds time scale, which can be used to characterize diffusion in porous media with features of approximately 2-3 mum and above (in common aqueous environments). Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), which operates in the nanoseconds-to-microseconds time scale with much better spin sensitivity, can in principle be employed to measure complex diffusion patterns in porous media with much finer features (down to approximately 10 nm). However, up to now, severe technical constraints precluded the adaptation of PGSE ESR to porous media research. In this work we demonstrate for the first time the use of PGSE ESR in the characterization of molecular restricted diffusion in common liquid solutions embedded in a model system for porous media made of sub-micron glass spheres. A unique ESR resonator, efficient gradient coils and fast gradient current drivers enable these measurements. This work can be further extended in the future to many applications that involve dynamical processes occurring in porous media with features in the deep sub-micron range down to true nanometric length scales.},

The ligands differ only by a terminal carboxylate and/or methyl group. A surprising non-additivity of functional group contributions for the carboxylate and/or methyl groups is detected. Adding the methyl first and then the carboxylate group results in a small Gibbs free energy increase and minor enthalpy/entropy partitioning for the first modification, whereas the second involves a strong affinity increase combined with large enthalpy/entropy changes. However, first adding the carboxylate and then the methyl group yields reverse effects: the acidic group attachment now causes minor effects, whereas the added methyl group provokes large changes. As all crystal structures show virtually identical binding modes, affinity changes are related to rearrangements of the first solvation layer next to the S(2)' pocket. About 20-25 water molecules are visible next to the studied complexes. The added COO(-) groups perturb the local water network in both carboxylated complexes, and the attached methyl groups provide favorable interaction sites for water molecules. Apart from one example, a contiguously connected water network between protein and ligand functional groups is observed in all complexes. In the complex with the carboxylated ligand, which still lacks the terminal methyl group, the water network is unfavorably ruptured. This results in a surprising thermodynamic signature showing only a minor affinity increase upon COO(-) group attachment. Because the further added methyl group provides a favorable interaction site for water, the network can be reestablished, and a strong affinity increase with a large enthalpy/entropy signature is then detected.},

Although the experiment superficially resembles the well-known Hartmann-Hahn cross polarization (CP) process introduced by Pines et al., that is widely used in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), it differs in significant respects. In particular, eNCP requires an alternative treatment due to the very different sizes of the specific terms in the spin Hamiltonian. We derive analytical expressions for the matching condition for optimal polarization transfer and verify their correctness with experimental results obtained with electron detected CP experiments performed on powder samples of BDPA radical dispersed in a protonated polystyrene matrix and with numerical simulations. We use fully protonated BDPA as an example of polarization transfer to strongly coupled nuclei. In contrast, perdeuterated BDPA serves as an example of the transfer of polarization from electrons to weakly coupled nuclei. In addition, we performed CP on a paramagnetic crystal to determine the influence of resolved hyperfine structure on the CP process. It is shown that almost no structure is observed in the corresponding electron-1H CP matching curve. It appears that only a restricted number of hyperfine coupled 1H's contribute to the observed signal intensities in the CP experiment.},

  abstract = {Multi-dimensional NMR spectra have traditionally been processed with the fast Fourier transformation (FFT). The availability of high field instruments, the complexity of spectra of large proteins, the narrow signal dispersion of some unstructured proteins, and the time needed to record the necessary increments in the indirect dimensions to exploit the resolution of the highfield instruments make this traditional approach unsatisfactory. New procedures need to be developed beyond uniform sampling of the indirect dimensions and reconstruction methods other than the straight FFT are necessary. Here we discuss approaches of non-uniform sampling (NUS) and suitable reconstruction methods. We expect that such methods will become standard for multi-dimensional NMR data acquisition with complex biological macromolecules and will dramatically enhance the power of modern biological NMR.},

One major contributor to these solvent effects is the hydrogen bonds that could be formed between the nitroxide moiety and water and/or the available hydroxyl groups. Here, formation of hydrogen bonds between a lipid bilayer spin probe5-doxyl stearic acid, 5DSAand hydrogen-bond donors has been studied using high-frequency (HF) pulsed ENDOR and EPR. A hydrogen-bonded deuteron was directly detected in HF ENDOR (130 GHz) spectra of 5DSA dissolved in several deuterated alcohols, while the characteristic signal was absent in nonpolar toluene-d(8). The length of the hydrogen bond, 1.74 +/- 0.06 A, and its geometry were found to be essentially the same for all four alcohols studied, indicating that nearly identical hydrogen bonds have been formed regardless of the solvent dielectric constant. This strengthens a hypothesis that HF EPR spectra are exclusively sensitive to formation of hydrogen bonds and could be used for probing the hydrogen-bond network in complex biomolecular assemblies and lipid bilayers with site-directed spin-labeling methods.},

A version of the experiment that uses a pulse train in the detection period exhibits improved signal-to-noise ratio. Tests on two nitroxide biradicals with known length indicate that the accessible range of distances extends from about 1.5 to 8 nm. The four-pulse DEER spectra of an ionic spin probe in an ionomer exhibit features due to probe molecules situated both on the same and on different ion clusters. The former feature provides information on the cluster size and is inaccessible with previous methods.},

In an efficient non-radiative microwave resonator, we observe average experimental enhancement factors up to -65. The local enhancement in the center of the resonator is calculated to reach a level of -94 at the highest microwave power. At high microwave power, the DNP enhancement shows a linear increase with no tendency to saturation. The results indicate that a substantial sensitivity enhancement is possible for liquid state NMR in nL sample volumes.},

Here we report a temperature-dependent investigation (170-260 K) of the behavior of hydration water under nanoconfinement by ESR techniques. A 26-mer-long peptide and the Bax protein are studied. This study provides site-specific information about the different local hydrations concurrently present in the protein/peptide solution, enabling a decent comparison of the hydration molecules-those that are buried inside, in contact with, and detached from the protein surface. Such a comparison is not possible without employing ESR under nanoconfinement. Though the confined bulk and surface hydrations behave differently, they both possess a transition similar to the reported fragile-to-strong crossover transition around 220 K. On the contrary, this transition is absent for the hydration near the buried sites of the protein. The activation energy determined under nanoconfinement is found to be lower in surface hydration than in bulk hydration. The protein structural flexibility, derived from the interspin distance distributions P(r) at different temperatures, is obtained by dipolar ESR spectroscopy. The P(r) result demonstrates that the structural flexibility is strongly correlated with the transition in the surface water, corroborating the origin of the protein dynamical transition at subfreezing temperatures.},

We probed the accessibility of these residues by (19)F-MAS NMR. For this purpose, an efficient but simple protocol for chemical fluorine labeling of accessible cysteines in membrane proteins was established. This one-step reaction was applied to detergent-solubilized PR before reconstitution into phospholipids. All three cysteines could be labeled and showed distinct (19)F chemical shifts with different integral intensities. The accessibility of these cysteines is discussed in the context of a homology model. With the chemical cysteine labeling procedure shown here, an attractive option for site-directed solid-state NMR studies on other membrane proteins is offered due to the high intrinsic sensitivity of (19)F-MAS NMR.},

The maximum degree of grafting achieved was 193{\%}. Both grafted monomers are hydrophilic and lead to high membrane affinity to phosphoric acid. Doping with phosphoric acid resulted in a maximum doping level of 310{\%}. The grafted membranes combine stable ETFE backbone polymer with hydrophilic side chains. As indicated by stress–strain curves the graft copolymer membranes show good mechanical stability. In addition, the polymer-acid-composites are thermally stable up to around 210°C. The polymer-acid-composite materials were tested in H2/O2 fuel cells at 120°C. Power densities of up to 108mW{\textperiodcentered}cm‒2 were obtained at a current density of 200mA{\textperiodcentered}cm‒2. It is shown that the alternate concept of polymer-acid composites without any basic units is also suitable for the application in high temperature fuel cells.},

  abstract  = {Linear passage pulses provide a simple approach to ultra-wideband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We show by numerical simulations that the efficiency of inversion of polarization or coherence order on a single transition by idealized passage pulses is an exponential function of critical adiabaticity during passage, which allows for defining an effective flip angle for fast passage. This result is confirmed by experiments on E' centers in Herasil glass. Deviations from the exponential law arise due to relaxation and a distribution of the adiabaticity parameter that comes from inhomogeneity of the irradiation field. Such inhomogeneity effects as well as edge effects in finite sweep bands cause a distribution of dynamic phase shifts, which can be partially refocused in echo experiments. In multilevel systems, passage of several transitions leads to generation of coherence on formally forbidden transitions that can also be described by the concept of an effective flip angle. On the one hand, such transfer to coherence on forbidden transitions is a significant magnetization loss mechanism for dipole-dipole coupled electron spin pairs at distances below about 2 nm. On the other hand, it can potentially be harnessed for electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments, where matching of the irradiation field strength to the nuclear Zeeman frequency leads to efficient generation of nuclear coherence and efficient back transfer to electron coherence on allowed transitions at high adiabaticity.},

The frequency, Q value, and resonator efficiency parameter Lambda for each mode of the coupled system were calculated as the size of the dielectric was varied. Other output parameters include the relative field magnitudes and phases. Two modes are found: one with fields in the dielectric parallel to the fields in the cavity center and the other with antiparallel fields. Results closely match those from a computer program that solves Maxwell's equations by finite element methods. Depending on the relative natural resonance frequencies of the cavity and dielectric, one mode has a higher Q value and correspondingly lower Lambda than the other. The mode with the higher Q value is preferentially excited by a coupling iris or loop in or near the cavity wall. However, depending on the frequency separation between modes, either can be excited in this way. A relatively narrow optimum is found for the size of the insert that produces maximum signal for both modes simultaneously. It occurs when the self-resonance frequencies of the two resonators are nearly equal. The maximum signal is almost the same as that of the dedicated TE(01delta) mode dielectric resonator alone, Lambda congruent with40 G/W(1/2) at X-band for a KTaO(3) crystal. The cavity is analogous to the second stage of a two-stage coupler. In general, there is no electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal benefit by use of a second stage. However, there is a benefit of convenience. A properly designed sample-mounted resonator inserted into a cavity can give EPR signals as large as what one would expect from the dielectric resonator alone.},

Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membranes with and without 50 mol{\%} cholesterol have been studied, and the results have been compared with similar studies at X-band (9.4 GHz) (L. Mainali, J.B. Feix, J.S. Hyde, W.K. Subczynski, J. Magn. Reson. 212 (2011) 418-425). Profiles of the spin-lattice relaxation rate (T(1)(-1)) obtained from SR EPR measurements for n-PCs and T-PC were used as a convenient quantitative measure of membrane fluidity. Additionally, spectral analysis using Freed's MOMD (microscopic-order macroscopic-disorder) model (E. Meirovitch, J.H. Freed J. Phys. Chem. 88 (1984) 4995-5004) provided rotational diffusion coefficients (R(perpendicular) and R(||)) and order parameters (S(0)). Spectral analysis at X-band provided one rotational diffusion coefficient, R(perpendicular). T(1)(-1), R(perpendicular), and R(||) profiles reflect local membrane dynamics of the lipid alkyl chain, while the order parameter shows only the amplitude of the wobbling motion of the lipid alkyl chain. Using these dynamic parameters, namely T(1)(-1), R(perpendicular), and R(||), one can discriminate the different effects of cholesterol at different depths, showing that cholesterol has a rigidifying effect on alkyl chains to the depth occupied by the rigid steroid ring structure and a fluidizing effect at deeper locations. The nondynamic parameter, S(0), shows that cholesterol has an ordering effect on alkyl chains at all depths. Conventional and SR EPR measurements with T-PC indicate that cholesterol has a fluidizing effect on phospholipid headgroups. EPR at W-band provides more detailed information about the depth-dependent dynamic organization of the membrane compared with information obtained at X-band. EPR at W-band has the potential to be a powerful tool for studying membrane fluidity in samples of small volume, {\~{}}30 nL, compared with a representative sample volume of {\~{}}3 $\mu$L at X-band.},

Numerous 17O MRD studies have demonstrated that this correlation time, when averaged over the first hydration shell, is longer than in bulk water by a factor 3–5. This rotational perturbation factor (RPF) has been corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations, which can also reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms.

abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) has great potential for use in reducing data acquisition time in MRI. Generally sparsity is used as a prior knowledge to improve the quality of reconstructed image. In this paper, we propose an effective compressed sensing rapid MR imaging method incorporating Non-Subsampled Shearlet transform (NSST) sparsity prior information for MR image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space data. In particular, we have implemented the more flexible decomposition with 2n directional subbands at each scale using NSST to obtain the prominent sparser representation for MR images. In addition, the mixed L1-L2 norm of the coefficients from the prior component and residual component is used to enforce joint sparsity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase signal sparsity and improve the ill-conditioning of MR imaging system using NSST sparsity regularization. The evaluations on a T2-weighted brain image and a MR phantom experiment demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction error reduction, detail preservation and aliasing, Gibbs ringing artifacts suppression compared to state-of-the-art technique. Its performance in objective evaluation indices outperforms conventional CS-MRI methods prominently.},

The spectra are in most cases found to be dramatically different for these two phases. Thus, visual inspection of the 2D-ELDOR spectra provides a convenient way to distinguish the two phases in membranes. Detailed analysis shows these observations are due to increased ordering in the Lo phase and modified reorientation rates. In the Lo phase, acyl chains undergo a faster rotational diffusion and higher ordering than in the Lc phase, whereas spin-labeled cholestane exhibits slower rotational diffusion and higher ordering. On the other hand, the choline headgroup in the Lo phase exhibits faster motion and reduced but realigned ordering versus the Lc phase. The microscopic translational diffusion rates in the Lo phase are significantly reduced in the presence of cholesterol. These results are compared with previous studies, and a consistent model is provided for interpreting them in terms of the differences in the dynamic structure of the Lo and Lc phases.},

abstract = {We report on electron-spin resonance microscopy (ESRM) providing sub-micron resolution ({\~{}}700nm) with a high spin concentration sample, i.e. lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) crystal. For biomedical applications of our ESRM, we have imaged samples containing rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells as well as cancerous tissue samples with a resolution of several microns using a water soluble spin probe, Trityl{\_}OX063{\_}d24. Phantom samples with the nitroxide spin label, (15)N PDT, were also imaged to demonstrate that nitroxides, which are commonly used as spin labels, may also be used for ESRM applications. ESRM tissue imaging would therefore be valuable for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Also, ESRM can be used to study the motility or the metabolism of cells in various environments. With further modification and/or improvement of imaging probe and spectrometer instrumentation sub-micron biological images should be obtainable, thereby providing a useful tool for various biomedical applications.},

In the first approach an almost uniform inversion is achieved by means of specially designed pulse trains with excitation patterns which match the three-line nitroxide ESR spectrum. In the second approach we essentially combine an inversion-recovery for the M(I) = 0 line with an analog of a pulsed ELDOR technique for M(I) = +/-1 lines in a single experiment; This allows us to reconstruct the recovery of the total magnetization of the ensemble of radicals which is not affected by spectral diffusion. The spin-lattice relaxation times of several nitroxide spin labels in different homogeneous and microheterogreneous environments are measured and compared. The temperature dependence of T-1 times is compared for two solvents, methylcyclohexane and carbon disulfide, which differ in nuclear spin concentration by almost a factor of 1000. The reported experimental evidence suggests that interactions with the nuclear spins of a solvent do not significantly contribute to the spin-lattice relaxation of nitroxide spin labels.},

It comprises of four basic units: input delay, filter, register bank, and control unit. The proposed architecture is systolic in nature and performs both high- and low-pass coefficient calculations with only one set of multipliers. In addition, it requires a small on-chip interface circuitry for interconnection to a standard communication bus. A detailed analysis of the effect of finite precision of data and wavelet filter coefficients on the accuracy of the DWT coefficients is presented. The architecture has been simulated in VLSI and has a hardware utilization efficiency of 87.5{\%}. Being systolic in nature, the architecture can compute DWT at a data rate of N/spl times/10/sup 6/ samples/s corresponding to a clock speed of N MHz.},

  abstract = {Proteins, the workhorses of living systems, are constructed from chains of amino acids, which are synthesized in the cell based on the instructions of the genetic code and then folded into working proteins. The time for folding varies from microseconds to hours. What controls the folding rate is hotly debated. We postulate here that folding has the same temperature dependence as the alpha-fluctuations in the bulk solvent but is much slower. We call this behavior slaving. Slaving has been observed in folded proteins: Large-scale protein motions follow the solvent fluctuations with rate coefficient k(alpha) but can be slower by a large factor. Slowing occurs because large-scale motions proceed in many small steps, each determined by k(alpha). If conformational motions of folded proteins are slaved, so a fortiori must be the motions during folding. The unfolded protein makes a Brownian walk in the conformational space to the folded structure, with each step controlled by k(alpha). Because the number of conformational substates in the unfolded protein is extremely large, the folding rate coefficient, k(f), is much smaller than k(alpha). The slaving model implies that the activation enthalpy of folding is dominated by the solvent, whereas the number of steps n(f) = k(alpha)/k(f) is controlled by the number of accessible substates in the unfolded protein and the solvent. Proteins, however, undergo not only alpha- but also beta-fluctuations. These additional fluctuations are local protein motions that are essentially independent of the bulk solvent fluctuations and may be relevant at late stages of folding.},

P., Khorana, H. G., and Hubbell, W. L. (1994) Science 266, 105-107]. We have extended these time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance studies in purple membranes by analyzing conformational changes detected by a spin-label at another site in the C-D loop (103), and at sites in the A-B loop (35), the D-E loop (130), and the E-F loop (160). In addition, we have investigated the motion detected by a spin-label at site 101 in a D96A mutant background that has a prolonged M intermediate. We find that among the examined sites, only spin-labels in the C-D loop detect a significant change in the local environment after the rise of M. Although the D96A mutation dramatically prolongs the lifetime of the M intermediate, it does not perturb either the structure of bacteriorhodopsin or the nature of the light-activated conformational change detected by a spin-label at site 101. In this mutant, a conformational change is detected during the lifetime of M, when no change in the 410 nm absorbance is observed. These results provide direct structural evidence for the heterogeneity of the M population in real time, and demonstrate that the motion detected at site 101 occurs in M, prior to Schiff base reprotonation.},

However, it is difficult to design techniques to treat long range forces in these systems without truncation or recourse to slowly convergent supercells or computationally inefficient Poisson solvers. In this paper, a rigorous reciprocal space based formalism which permits long range forces on wires to be evaluated simply and easily via a small modification of existing methods for three dimensional periodicity is derived. The formalism is applied to determine long range interactions both between point particles using an Ewald-like approach and the continuous charge distributions that appear in electronic structure calculations. In this way, both empirical force field calculations and, for example, plane-wave based density functional theory computations on wires can be performed easily. The methodology is tested on model and realistic systems including a lithium doped carbon nanotube.},

Since the breadth of the 4-amino TEMPO EPR spectrum is large compared to the nuclear Larmor frequency, it has been assumed that thermal mixing (TM) is the dominate mechanism by which polarization is transferred from electron to nuclear spins. However, theoretical explanations of TM generally assume a homogeneously broadened EPR line and, since the 4-amino TEMPO line at 5 T is inhomogeneously broadened, they do not explain the observed DNP enhancements. Accordingly, we have developed a treatment of DNP that explicitly uses electron-electron cross-relaxation to mediate electron-nuclear polarization transfer. The process proceeds via spin flip-flops between pairs of electronic spin packets whose Zeeman temperatures differ from one another. To confirm the essential features of the model we have studied the field dependence of electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) data and DNP enhancement data. Both are well simulated using a simple model of electron cross-relaxation in the inhomogeneously broadened 4-amino TEMPO EPR line. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Nanometer distances in nucleic acids can be measured by EPR using two 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline radicals, with each label attached via a methylene group to a phosphorothioate-substituted backbone position as one of two phosphorothioate diastereomers (R(P) and S(P)). Correlating the internitroxide distance to the geometry of the parent molecule requires computational analysis of the label conformers. Here, we report sixteen 4-ns MD simulations on a DNA duplex d(CTACTGCTTTAG) .d(CTAAAGCAGTAG) with label pairs at C7/C19, T5/A17, and T2/T14, respectively. For each labeled duplex, four simulations were performed with S(P)/S(P), R(P)/R(P), S(P)/R(P), and R(P)/S(P) labels, with initial all trans label conformations. Another set of four simulations was performed for the 7/19-labeled duplex using a different label starting conformation. The average internitroxide distance r(MD) was within 0.2 A for the two sets of simulations for the 7/19-labeled duplex, indicating sufficient sampling of conformational space. For all three labeled duplexes studied, r(MD) agreed with experimental values, as well as with average distances obtained from an efficient conformer search algorithm (NASNOX). The simulations also showed that the labels have conformational preferences determined by the linker chemistry and label-DNA interactions. These results establish computational algorithms that allow use of the 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline label for mapping global structures of nucleic acids.},

The cell efficiency is critically affected by the charge-transfer exciton recombination and dissociation processes. By measuring the magneto-photocurrent under ambient conditions at room temperature, we show here that magnetic field-induced spin-mixing among the charge-transfer exciton spin sublevels occurs in fields up to at least 8.5 Tesla. The resulting magneto-photocurrent increases at high fields showing non-saturating behaviour up to the highest applied field. We attribute the observed high-field spin-mixing mechanism to the difference in the donor-acceptor g-factors. The non-saturating magneto-photocurrent response at high field indicates that there exist charge-transfer excitons with lifetime in the sub-nanosecond time domain. The non-Lorentzian high-field magneto-photocurrent response indicates a dispersive decay mechanism that originates due to a broad distribution of charge-transfer exciton lifetimes.},

  abstract = {A quantitative test of the ENDOR theory for free radicals in solution has been developed experimentally using the semiquinone (SQ) radical anions of parabenzo- (PBSQ), duro- (DSQ), and 2,5-dimethyl-para-benzo- (2,5-DPMBSQ) dissolved in ethyl alcohol (EtOH) and dimethoxyethane (DME) solvents. It is shown that, in general, an ENDOR signal arising from a molecule containing four or less equivalent nuclei, such as PBSQ, can be analyzed rigorously whereas a molecule containing more than four equivalent nuclei, such as DSQ, which, in principle, could be analyzed rigorously, practically is best analyzed using approximate forms of the ENDOR theory. It is shown that 2,5-DMPBSQ may be analyzed using a combination of both the rigorous and approximate forms of the ENDOR theory. The analysis involves calculation of the ENDOR relaxation parameters, T2n, n, and e,n, from the experimental ENDOR percent enhancement and linewidth studies. A comparison was made by performing the ESR linewidth and saturation studies to obtain values of We, the electron spin–lattice relaxation probability, and Wn, the nuclear spin-relaxation probability and then using this information to predict the observed ENDOR relaxation parameters in terms of the theory. The over-all behavior of the experimental results was found to be fully consistent with the general trends predicted by the theory and expected from the quantitative measurements obtained from the ESR studies. This work describes in detail the instrumentation and experimental methods necessary to measure relaxation parameters of organic free radicals in solution. A comprehensive section describing the effects of modulation amplitude, microwave power, coherence broadening or splitting, and pulse rate is given along with methods for analyzing ENDOR line shapes in their presence. The results and analyses of all ESR and ENDOR experiments are described in detail. Analysis of the rotational correlation time R, obtained from the ESR studies, shows the radical anions in DME solution are most likely solvated and affected by the counterion and/or supporting electrolyte while PBSQ in EtOH is most likely dissociated. A comparison of the experimental and theoretical magnitudes of We leads to the possibility that for small molecules in liquids a Brownian model of reorientation by infinitesimal jumps need not be satisfactory and that jumps of large angle would be needed to better fit the experimental data. The effect of Heisenberg exchange on ENDOR signals is analyzed and discussed in detail, leading to the conclusion that the intermolecular electron–electron dipolar interaction as well as Heisenberg exchange make contributions to the concentration dependent portion of the linewidth. However, the latter contributes much more to the ESR linewidths as compared to the ENDOR widths for PBSQ in EtOH. The above analysis is modified to include charge effects. Finally it is shown that for methyl group ENDOR cross relaxation from modulation of the isotropic hyperfine splitting via methyl group rotation is not the dominant nuclear relaxation mechanism and all methyl group ENDOR analyses are consistent with a Wn derived from the pseudosecular terms of the anisotropic electron–nuclear dipolar interaction.},

  abstract  = {In life science, water is the ubiquitous solvent, sometimes even called the "matrix of life". There is increasing experimental and theoretical evidence that solvation water is not a passive spectator in biomolecular processes. New experimental techniques can quantify how water interacts with biomolecules and, in doing so, differs from "bulk" water. Terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy has turned out to be a powerful tool to study (bio)molecular hydration. The main concepts that have been developed in the recent years to describe the underlying solute-induced sub-picosecond dynamics of the hydration shell are discussed herein. Moreover, we highlight recent findings that show the significance of hydrogen bond dynamics for the function of antifreeze proteins and for molecular recognition. In all of these examples, a gradient of water motion toward functional sites of proteins is observed, the so-called "hydration funnel". By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we provide new evidence for a specific water-protein coupling as the cause of the observed dynamical heterogeneity. The efficiency of the coupling at THz frequencies is explained in terms of a two-tier (short- and long-range) solute-solvent interaction.},

A tradeoff between noise reduction and the preservation of actual detail features has to be made in the way that enhances the diagnostically relevant image content. Therefore, noise reduction is still a difficult task. A variety of techniques have been presented in the literature on denoising MR images and each technique has its own assumptions, advantages and limitations. The purpose of this paper is to present a survey of the published literature in dealing with denoising methods in MR images. After a brief introduction about magnetic resonance imaging and the characteristics of noise in MRI, the popular approaches are classified into different groups and an overview of various methods is provided. The denoising method's advantages and limitations are also discussed.},

The determination of distance distributions in electron spin pairs directly from the dipolar time evolution of the pulsed ESR signals by means of the Tikhonov regularization method is reported. The difficulties connected with numerically inverting this ill-posed mathematical problem are clearly illustrated. The Tikhonov regularization with the regularization parameter determined by the L-curve criterion is then described and tested to confirm its accuracy and reliability. The method is applied to recent experimental results on doubly labeled proteins that have been studied using two pulsed ESR techniques, double quantum coherence (DQC) ESR and double electron-electron resonance (DEER). The extracted distance distributions are able to provide valuable information about the conformational constraints in various partially folded states of proteins. This study supplies a mathematically reliable method for extracting pair distributions from pulsed ESR experimental data and has extended the use of pulsed ESR to provide results of greater value for structural biology.},

  abstract  = {The disaccharide trehalose stabilizes proteins against unfolding, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Because trehalose is preferentially excluded from the protein surface, it is of interest to examine how trehalose modifies the structure and dynamics of the solvent. From the spin relaxation rates of deuterated trehalose and (17)O-enriched water, we obtain the rotational dynamics of trehalose and water in solutions over wide ranges of concentration (0.025-1.5 M) and temperature (236-293 K). The results reveal direct solute-solute interactions at all concentrations, consistent with transient trehalose clusters. Similar to other organic solutes, the trehalose perturbation of water rotation (and hydrogen-bond exchange) is modest: a factor 1.6 (at 298 K) on average for the 47 water molecules in the first hydration layer. The deviation of the solute tumbling time from the Stokes-Einstein-Debye relation is partly caused by a dynamic solvent effect that is often modeled by incorporating "bound water" in the hydrodynamic volume. By comparing the measured temperature dependences of trehalose and water dynamics, we demonstrate that a more realistic local viscosity model accounts for this second-order dynamic coupling.},

Photoconductivity transients, resulting from the formation of mobile, conduction band electrons in the semiconductor have been measured on excitation with 3 ns pulses of UV (300 nm) and visible (410-700 nm) light. The product of the yield of formation of mobile charge carriers, phi, and the sum of their mobilities, Sigmamicro, has been determined from the maximum conductivity for light intensities varying from approximately 10(12) to approximately 10(16) photons/cm(2)/pulse. For the bare nc-TiO(2) layer at 300 nm and the coated layer at all wavelengths, phiSigmamicro initially increased with increasing intensity, reached a maximum, and eventually decreased at high intensities. The initial increase is attributed to the gradual filling of (surface) electron trapping sites. This effect was absent when the samples were continuously illuminated with background irradiation at 300 nm with an intensity of 6 x 10(13) photons/cm(2)/s (40 microW/cm(2)), thereby presaturating the trapping sites prior to the laser pulse. The trap-free mobility of electrons within these 9 nm nanoparticles is estimated to be 0.034 cm(2)/Vs at 9 GHz. The eventual decrease in phiSigmamicro at intensities corresponding to an electron occupancy of more than one electron per particle is unaffected by background illumination, and is attributed to a decrease in micro due to electron-electron interactions within the semiconductor particles. The photoconductivity action spectrum of the coated nc-TiO(2) layer closely followed the photon attenuation spectrum in the visible of the porphyrin, with a charge separation efficiency per absorbed photon of 18{\%} at the Soret band maximum. The after-pulse decay of the photoconductivity showed a power law behavior over a time scale of nanoseconds to several hundreds of microseconds, which is attributed to multiple trapping and detrapping events at chemical or physical defects within the semiconductor matrix.},

However, the applicability of these experiments, which are based on (13)C- and (15)N-detected spectra, would be enhanced if the sensitivity were improved. Here we discuss two advances that address this problem: high-frequency dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and (1)H-detected MAS techniques. DNP is a sensitivity enhancement technique that transfers the high polarization of exogenous unpaired electrons to nuclear spins via microwave irradiation of electron-nuclear transitions. DNP boosts NMR signal intensities by factors of 10(2) to 10(3), thereby overcoming NMR's inherent low sensitivity. Alternatively, it permits structural investigations at the nanomolar scale. In addition, (1)H detection is feasible primarily because of the development of MAS rotors that spin at frequencies of 40 to 60 kHz or higher and the preparation of extensively (2)H-labeled proteins.},

Dedicated EPR and NMR coils were devised to minimize radiofrequency power deposition with high signal-to-noise ratio. Trityl and nitroxide radicals were used to characterize oxygen and redox sensitivities of multispin echo Overhauser-enhanced MRI. Oxygen resolution of 3 mmHg was obtained from 2 mM deoxygenated trityl phantoms. Trityl radicals were stable in reducing environments and did not alter the redox-sensitive decaying rate of the nitroxide signals. Nitroxide radicals had a compounding effect for the trityl oximetry. Tumor oxygenation and redox status were acquired with anatomical images by injecting trityl and nitroxide probes subsequently in murine tumors. The Overhauser-enhanced MRI-Prepolarized MRI system is ready for quantitative longitudinal imaging studies of tumor hypoxia and redox status as radiotherapy prognostic factors.},

By permitting straightforward single molecule (SM) detection and imaging with organic fluorophores, chemical tags have the potential to advance SM imaging as a routine experimental tool for studying biological mechanism. However, there has been little characterization of the photophysical consequences of using chemical tags with organic fluorophores. Here, we examine the effect the covalent trimethoprim chemical tag (A-TMP-tag) has on the SM imaging performance of the fluorophores, Atto655 and Alexa647, by evaluating the photophysical properties of these fluorophores and their A-TMP-tag conjugates. We measure SM photon flux, survival lifetime, and total photon output under conditions that mimic the live cell environment and demonstrate that the A-TMP-tag complements the advantageous SM imaging properties of Atto655 and Alexa647. We also measure the ensemble properties of quantum yield and photostability lifetime, revealing a correlation between SM and ensemble properties. Taken together, these findings establish a systematic method for evaluating the impact chemical tags have on fluorophores for SM imaging and demonstrate that the A-TMP-tag with Atto655 and Alexa647 are promising reagents for biological imaging.},

  abstract = {Effects of specific ions on the local translational diffusion of water near large hydrophilic lipid vesicle surfaces were measured by Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP). ODNP relies on an unpaired electron spin-containing probe located at molecular or surface sites to report on the dynamics of water protons within {\~{}}10 {\AA} from the spin probe, which give rise to spectral densities for electron-proton cross-relaxation processes in the 10 GHz regime. This pushes nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry to more than an order of magnitude higher frequencies than conventionally feasible, permitting the measurement of water moving with picosecond to subnanosecond correlation times. Diffusion of water within {\~{}}10 {\AA} of, i.e., up to {\~{}}3 water layers around the spin probes located on hydrophilic lipid vesicle surfaces is {\~{}}5 times retarded compared to the bulk water translational diffusion. This directly reflects on the activation barrier for surface water diffusion, i.e., how tightly water is bound to the hydrophilic surface and surrounding waters. We find this value to be modulated by the presence of specific ions in solution, with its order following the known Hofmeister series. While a molecular description of how ions affect the hydration structure at the hydrophilic surface remains to be answered, the finding that Hofmeister ions directly modulate the surface water diffusivity implies that the strength of the hydrogen bond network of surface hydration water is directly modulated on hydrophilic surfaces.},

  abstract  = {Tracking the folding kinetics of macromolecules under molecular crowding conditions represents a tremendous challenge due to the high viscosity of the solution. In this paper, we report a unique T-type microfluidic mixer with seven consecutive $\omega$-shaped baffles for fast mixing of high-viscosity fluids. Numerical simulations and experimental characterizations proved that the micromixer could achieve a mixing time of 579.4 $\mu$s for solutions with viscosities about 33.6 times that of pure water. Over a 1000-fold improvement in mixing dead time was accomplished in comparison to those reported previously. We further used this highly efficient micromixer to track the early folding kinetics of human telomere G-quadruplex under molecular crowding conditions. Results indicated an exponential process in the initial folding phase of G-quadruplex, and the G-quadruplex formed a more compact structure under higher degrees of molecular crowding conditions.},

Protein dynamics plays a fundamental role in many diseases, and spans a large hierarchy of timescales, from picoseconds to milliseconds or even longer. Nanoscale protein domain motion on length scales comparable to protein dimensions is key to understanding how signals are relayed through multiple protein-protein interactions. A canonical example is how the scaffolding proteins NHERF1 and ezrin work in coordination to assemble crucial membrane complexes. As membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding proteins, these provide excellent prototypes for understanding how regulatory signals are relayed through protein-protein interactions between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the structure and dynamics of the interaction. We describe recent novel applications of neutron spin echo spectroscopy to reveal the dynamic propagation of allosteric signals by nanoscale protein motion, and present a guide to the future study of dynamics and its application to the cure of disease.},

Water accessibility of residues may change during folding or function-related structural dynamics. Several techniques based on the combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with site-directed spin labeling can be used to quantify such water accessibility. Accessibility parameters for different residues in major plant light-harvesting complex IIb are determined by electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy in the presence of deuterated water, deuterium contrast in transversal relaxation rates, analysis of longitudinal relaxation rates, and line shape analysis of electron-spin-echo-detected EPR spectra as well as by the conventional techniques of measuring the maximum hyperfine splitting and progressive saturation in continuous-wave EPR. Systematic comparison of these parameters allows for a more detailed characterization of the environment of the spin-labeled residues. These techniques are applicable independently of protein size and require approximately 10-20 nmol of singly spin-labeled protein per sample. For a residue close to the N-terminus, in a domain unresolved in the existing x-ray structures of light-harvesting complex IIb, all methods indicate high water accessibility.},

It was shown, by comparison to dispersions of SM,  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and DPPC/cholesterol of molar  ratio 1, that DRM contains a substantial amount of liquid ordered  phase: 1) The rotational diffusion rates (R( perpendicular)) of 16PC in  DRM between -5 degrees C and 45 degrees C are nearly the same as those  in molar ratio DPPC/Chol = 1 dispersions, and they are substantially  greater than R( perpendicular) in pure DPPC dispersions in the gel  phase studied above 20 degrees C; 2) The order parameters (S) of 16PC  in DRM at temperatures above 4 degrees C are comparable to those in  DPPC/Chol = 1 dispersions, but are greater than those in DPPC  dispersions in both the gel and liquid crystalline phases. 3)  Similarly, R( perpendicular) for 5PC and CSL in DRM is greater than in  pure SM dispersions in the gel phase, and S for these labels in DRM is  greater than in the SM dispersions in both the gel and liquid  crystalline phases. 4) R( perpendicular) of SD-Tempo in DRM is greater  than in dispersions of SM in both gel and liquid phases, consistent  with the liquid-like mobility in the acyl chain region in DRM. However,  S of SD-Tempo in DRM is substantially less than that of this spin label  in SM in gel and liquid crystalline phases (in absolute values),  indicating that the headgroup region in DRMs is less ordered than in  pure SM. These results support the hypothesis that plasma membranes  contain DRM domains with a liquid ordered phase that may coexist with a  liquid crystalline phase. There also appears to be a coexisting region  in DRMs in which the chain labels 16PC and 5PC are found to cluster. We  suggest that other biological membranes containing high concentrations  of cholesterol also contain a liquid ordered phase.},

We used NMR methods to characterize Rheb tethered to nanodiscs, monodisperse protein-encapsulated lipid bilayers with a diameter of 10 nm. Membrane conjugation markedly reduced the rate of intrinsic nucleotide exchange, while GTP hydrolysis was unchanged. NMR measurements revealed that the GTPase domain interacts transiently with the surface of the bilayer in two distinct preferred orientations, which are determined by the bound nucleotide. We propose models of membrane-dependent signal regulation by Rheb that shed light on previously unexplained in vivo properties of this GTPase. The study presented provides a general approach for direct experimental investigation of membrane-dependent properties of other Ras-superfamily GTPases.},

  abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion diseases are increasingly being realized to have common cellular and molecular mechanisms including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation. The aggregates usually consist,of fibers containing misfolded protein with a beta-sheet conformation, termed amyloid. There is partial but not perfect overlap among the cells in which abnormal proteins are deposited and the cells that degenerate. The most likely explanation is that inclusions and other visible protein aggregates represent an end stage of a molecular cascade of several steps, and that earlier steps in the cascade may be more directly tied to pathogenesis than the inclusions themselves. For several diseases, genetic variants assist in explaining the pathogenesis of the more common sporadic forms and developing mouse and other models. There is now increased understanding of the pathways involved in protein aggregation, and some recent clues have emerged as to the molecular mechanisms of cellular toxicity. These are leading to approaches toward rational therapeutics.},

The contrast agents that are currently available give enhancement factors that are too low to make the technique a valid option for routine clinical use. Material and Methods. MR images were generated directly following the injection of the substance into rats. The MR scanner was operated at a main magnetic field of 0.01 T and equipped with a separate rf-transmitter tuned to the electron paramagnetic resonance frequency of the contrast agent. Results. As expected, the images generated show a high level of enhancement in areas where the contrast agent was present, and a maximum enhancement of 60 times the normal proton signal was obtained in the vascular area. The signal-to-noise ratios in the images were superior to those previously attained. Conclusion: The new contrast agent makes it possible to generate MR images with both morphological and functional information at 0.01 T The signal-to-noise ratios found in the generated images were of the same order as, or better than, those obtained with the standard clinical routine. },

The observation of highly selective relaxation effects on the NMR spectra of OmpX and DHPC from a water-sol. relaxation agent and from nitroxide spin labels attached to lipophilic mols., confirmed data obtained previously with more complex NMR studies of the diamagnetic OmpX/DHPC system, and yielded addnl. novel insights into the protein - detergent interactions in the mixed micelles. The application of paramagnetic probes to the well characterized OmpX/DHPC system indicates that such probes should be widely applicable as an efficient support of NMR studies of the topol. of mixed membrane protein - detergent micelles.

abstract = {Internal motion is central to protein folding, to protein stability through the resulting residual entropy, and to protein function. Despite its importance, the precise nature of the internal motions of protein macromolecules remains a mystery. Here we report a survey of the temperature dependence of the fast dynamics of methyl-bearing side chains in a calmodulin-peptide complex using site-specific deuterium NMR relaxation methods. The amplitudes of motion had a markedly heterogeneous spectrum and segregated into three largely distinct classes. Other proteins studied at single temperatures tend to segregate similarly. Furthermore, a large variability in the degree of thermal activation of the dynamics in the calmodulin complex indicates a heterogeneous distribution of residual entropy and hence reveals the microscopic origins of heat capacity in proteins. These observations also point to an unexpected explanation for the low-temperature 'glass transition' of proteins. It is this transition that has been ascribed to the creation of protein motional modes that are responsible for biological activity.},

abstract = {A unique feature of chemical catalysis mediated by enzymes is that the catalytically reactive atoms are embedded within a folded protein. Although current understanding of enzyme function has been focused on the chemical reactions and static three-dimensional structures, the dynamic nature of proteins has been proposed to have a function in catalysis. The concept of conformational substates has been described; however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein flexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with NMR relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously, we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of CypA. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional electron-electron double resonance (2D-ELDOR) is a technique that is sensitive to the dynamical processes affecting spin labels in complex fluid environments. In ordered fluids, such as membrane vesicles, the 2D-ELDOR experiment is affected by the molecular tumbling in the locally ordered environment. This motion occurs on two different time scales, the faster molecular motion relative to the local director, and the slower collective fluctuations of the director field. In the experimental study of Patyal, Crepeau, and Freed (Biophys. J. 1997, 73, 2201), it was found that the widths of the autopeaks of the 2D-ELDOR spectrum increased as a function of the mixing time. In the present work, a theory is developed for the effects of director fluctuations on the autopeaks in the 2D-ELDOR experiment by employing an analytical solution of the stochastic Liouville equation for which the director field is treated as a multidimensional Gaussian process, as previously developed by Frezzato, Kothe, and Moro (J. Phys. Chem. B 2001, 105, 1281 and J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 9505). Good agreement is found between theory and experiment, notably the only adjustable parameter is k, the bending elastic modulus of the membrane. The values of k = 11 x 10(-20) J for 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles and k = 15 x 10(-20) J for DPPC/gramicidin A (5:1) vesicles, both at 45 degrees C, were found from the analysis and agree well with previous related measurements by other physical techniques. This establishes 2D-ELDOR as a useful technique to study the elastic properties of biological membranes.},

In this study, we investigated the substrate protein human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) while bound to GroEL or to a single-ring analog, SR1, by NMR spectroscopy in solution under conditions where hDHFR was efficiently recovered as a folded, enzymatically active protein from the stable complexes upon addition of ATP and GroES. By using the NMR techniques of transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY), cross-correlated relaxation-induced polarization transfer (CRIPT), and cross-correlated relaxation-enhanced polarization transfer (CRINEPT), bound hDHFR could be observed directly. Measurements of the buildup of hDHFR NMR signals by different magnetization transfer mechanisms were used to characterize the dynamic properties of the NMR-observable parts of the bound substrate. The NMR data suggest that the bound state includes random coil conformations devoid of stable native-like tertiary contacts and that the bound hDHFR might best be described as a dynamic ensemble of randomly structured conformers.},

Oxidized rubredoxin showed an increased water (1)H relaxation profile with respect to the diamagnetic gallium derivative or reduced species. Analysis of the data shows evidence of exchangeable proton(s) approximately 4.0-4.5 A from the metal ion, the exchange time being longer than 10(-10) s and shorter than 10(-5) s. The correlation time for the proton-electrons interaction is 7 x 10(-11) s and is attributed to the effective electron relaxation time. Its magnitude is consistent with the large signal linewidths of the protein donor nuclei, observed in high resolution NMR spectra. For reduced rubredoxin, such correlation time is proposed to be smaller than 10(-11) s. (17)O relaxation measurements suggest the presence of at least one long-lived protein-bound water molecule. Analogous relaxation measurements were performed on the C6S rubredoxin variant, whose iron(III) center has been previously shown to be coordinated to three cysteine residues and a hydroxide ion above pH 6. (1)H nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profiles indicate increased hydration with respect to the wild-type.},

  abstract = {The set-up of a new microwave bridge for a 95 GHz pulse EPR spectrometer is described. The virtues of the bridge are its simple and flexible design and its relatively high output power (0.7 W) that generates ?? pulses of 25 ns and a microwave field, B1 = 0.71 mT. Such a high B1 enhances considerably the sensitivity of high field double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measurements for distance determination, as we demonstrate on a nitroxide biradical with an interspin distance of 3.6 nm. Moreover, it allowed us to carry out HYSCORE (hyperfine sublevel-correlation) experiments at 95 GHz, observing nuclear modulation frequencies of 14N and 17O as high as 40 MHz. This opens a new window for the observation of relatively large hyperfine couplings, yet not resolved in the EPR spectrum, that are difficult to observe with HYSCORE carried out at conventional X-band frequencies. The correlations provided by the HYSCORE spectra are most important for signal assignment, and the improved resolution due to the two dimensional character of the experiment provides 14N quadrupolar splittings. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

For simple SDS solns., the rotational correlation time increases slightly with surfactant concn. while the polarity decreases slightly. In contrast, however, in the presence of gelatin these properties vary markedly as a function of the stoichiometric ratio of the concn. of surfactant to gelatin; the correlation time decreasing and the hyperfine coupling const. increasing with increasing surfactant concn. In the presence of gelatin therefore, 16-DSE reports a very different micellar environment compared with the simple SDS case. Furthermore, this environment differs significantly from that obsd. in solns. of synthetic, nonionic homopolymers and SDS. These features arise due to the varied characteristics of the amino acids present in the protein. [on SciFinder (R)]},

By trypsin digestion of the MSL-labeled ras(1-171) protein, MSL-labeled peptide fragments were isolated and sequenced. The cysteine residue in position 118 of the protein, but not the other cysteine residues, Cys-51 or Cys-80, was found to be specifically labeled by MSL. The ESR spectrum of the MSL-labeled ras(1-171) protein indicates that the MSL group attached to Cys-118 is strongly immobilized. Proton NMR spectra at 400-MHz were measured for this MSL-labeled ras(1-171) protein and also for a control sample of a labeled ras(1-171) protein whose MSL was reduced by sodium ascorbate. In the difference spectra for these two proteins, resonances of protons in the vicinity of the MSL group attached to Cys-118 of the ras(1-171) protein were observed. Thus, the MSL group was found to be in the vicinity of the protein-bound GDP. A phenylalanine residue and two histidine residues, which were characterized by 2D HOHAHA and DQF-COSY spectra, were also found to be in the vicinity of MSL. NOE and pH titration analyses indicate that this phenylalanine residue is close to the bound GDP and one of the two histidine residues. By carboxypeptidase digestion, the two histidine residues near MSL were identified as His-27 and His-94.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Water molecules in confined environments with pools a few nanometers in diameter or at interfaces undergo hydrogen bond structural dynamics that differ drastically from the dynamics they undergo in bulk water. Orientational motions of water require hydrogen bond network rearrangement. Therefore, observations of orientational relaxation in nanoscopic water systems provide information about the influence of confinement and interfaces on hydrogen bond dynamics. Ultrafast infrared polarization- and wavelength-selective pump-probe experiments can measure the orientational relaxation of water and distinguish water at an interface from water removed from an interface. These experiments can be applied to water in reverse micelles (spherical nanopools). The results provide quantitative determination of the dynamics of water as a function of the size and nature of the confining structure.},

  abstract = {Dynamics are hypothesized to play an important role in the trans- mission of signals across membranes by receptors. Bacterial chemo- receptors are long helical proteins that consist of a periplasmic ligand-binding domain; a transmembrane region; a cytoplasmic HAMP (histidine kinase, adenylyl cyclases, methyl-accepting chemo- taxis proteins, and phosphatases) domain; and a kinase-control module (KCM). The KCM is further composed of adaptation, hinge, and protein interaction regions (PIRs), the latter of which binds the histidine kinase CheA and adaptor CheW. Fusions of the Escherichia coli aspartate receptor KCM to HAMP domains of defined structure (H1-Tar vs. H1-2-Tar) give opposite responses in phosphotransfer and cellular assays, despite similar binding to CheA and CheW. Pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy (PDS) of these isolated on and off dimeric effectors reveals that, in the kinase-on state, the HAMP is more con- formationally destabilized compared with the PIR, whereas in the kinase-off state, the HAMP is more compact, and the PIR samples a greater breadth of conformations. On and off HAMP states pro- duce different conformational effects at the KCMjunction, but these differences decrease through the adaptation region and into the hinge only to return with the inverted relationship in the PIR. Con- tinuous wave–ESR of the spin-labeled proteins confirms that broader PDS distance distributions correlatewith increased rates of dynamics. Conformational breadth in the adaptation region changes with charge alterations caused by modification enzymes. Activating mod- ifications broaden the HAMP conformational ensemble but corre- spondingly, compact the PIR. Thus, chemoreceptors behave as coupled units, in which dynamics in regions proximal and distal to the membrane change coherently but with opposite sign.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is a widespread phenomenon present in many human solid tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis and therapy resistance. Here, we tested the feasibility of melittin, a major component of bee venom, on radiosensitization of hypoxic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). CNE-2 and KB cells were treated with melittin and radiation response was determined. Cell viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction were examined by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1$\alpha$) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins were assessed using western blotting. Additionally, we also examined the effect of melittin on tumor growth and radiosensitivity in vivo using a xenograft model of HNSCC. Treatment with melittin resulted in cell growth inhibition, induction of cell apoptosis, and reduction of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF expression, which has been linked to hypoxia cell radioresistance. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of melittin significantly reduced the growth of HNSCC tumors in CNE-2 tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that melittin enhances radiosensitivity of HNSCC under hypoxia condition, and this is associated with the suppression of HIF-1$\alpha$ expression. Melittin appears to be a potential radiotherapy sensitization agent due to its significant antihypoxia activity.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) depends on the local dynamics modulating the dipolar coupling between the two interacting spins. By attaching nitroxide based spin labels to molecules and by measuring the (1)H DNP response of solvent water, information about the local hydration dynamics near the spin label can be obtained. However, there are two commonly used types of nitroxide ring structures; a pyrroline based and a piperidine based molecule. It is important to know when comparing different experiments, whether changes in DNP enhancements are due to changes in local hydration dynamics or because of the different spin label structures. In this study we investigate the key parameters affecting DNP signal enhancements for 3-carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolin-1-oxyl, a 5-membered ring nitroxide radical, and for 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, a 6-membered ring nitroxide radical. Using X-Band DNP, field cycling relaxometry, and molecular dynamics simulations, we conclude that the key parameters affecting the DNP amplitude of the (1)H signal of water to be equal when using either nitroxide. Thus, experiments measuring hydration dynamics using either type of spin labels may be compared.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Hydration largely determines solubility, aggregation of proteins and influences interactions between proteins and drug molecules. Despite the importance of hydration, structural determination of hydration structure of protein surfaces is still challenging from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints. The precision of experimental measurements is often affected by fluctuations and mobility of water molecules resulting in uncertain assignment of water positions.

RESULTS: Our method can utilize mobility as an information source for the prediction of hydration structure. The necessary information can be produced by molecular dynamics simulations accounting for all atomic interactions including water-water contacts. The predictions were validated and tested by comparison to more than 1500 crystallographic water positions in 20 hydrated protein molecules including enzymes of biomedical importance such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2. The agreement with experimental water positions was larger than 80{\%} on average. The predictions can be particularly useful in situations where no or limited experimental knowledge is available on hydration structures of molecular surfaces.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is implemented in a standalone C program MobyWat released under the GNU General Public License, freely accessible with full documentation at http://www.mobywat.com.

The dominant dielectric dispersion mechanism in the paraelectric phase was shown to be of strongly anharmonic soft-phonon origin. The whole soft-mode response in the vicinity of the ferroelectric transition was shown to consist of two coupled overdamped THz excitations, which show classical features of a coupled soft and central mode, known from many ferroelectric crystals with a dynamics near the displacive and order-disorder crossover. Similar behaviour has been recently revealed and theoretically simulated in pure BaTiO(3) (see Ponomareva et al 2008 Phys. Rev. B 77 012102 and Hlinka et al 2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 167402). Also for the BST system, this feature was confirmed by the theory based on molecular dynamics simulations with an effective first-principles Hamiltonian. In all the ferroelectric phases, additional relaxation dispersion appeared in the GHz range, assigned to ferroelectric domain-wall dynamics. The microwave losses were analysed from the point of view of applications. The paraelectric losses above 1 GHz are comparable with those in single crystals and appear to be of intrinsic multi-phonon origin. The ceramic BST system is therefore well suited for applications in the whole microwave range.},

  abstract = {DNA polymerase $\beta$ (Pol $\beta$) is a 39-kDa enzyme that performs the vital cellular function of repairing damaged DNA. Mutations in Pol $\beta$ have been linked to various cancers, and these mutations are further correlated with altered Pol $\beta$ enzymatic activity. The fidelity of correct nucleotide incorporation into damaged DNA is essential for Pol $\beta$ repair function, and several studies have implicated conformational changes in Pol $\beta$ as a determinant of this repair fidelity. In this work, the rate constants for domain motions in Pol $\beta$ have been determined by solution NMR relaxation dispersion for the apo and substrate-bound, binary forms of Pol $\beta$. In apo Pol $\beta$, molecular motions, primarily isolated to the DNA lyase domain, are observed to occur at 1400 s(-1). Additional analysis suggests that these motions allow apo Pol $\beta$ to sample a conformation similar to the gapped DNA-substrate-bound form. Upon binding DNA, these lyase domain motions are significantly quenched, whereas evidence for conformational motions in the polymerase domain becomes apparent. These NMR studies suggest an alteration in the dynamic landscape of Pol $\beta$ due to substrate binding. Moreover, a number of the flexible residues identified in this work are also the location of residues, which upon mutation lead to cancer phenotypes in vivo, which may be due to the intimate role of protein motions in Pol $\beta$ fidelity.},

Intensities, lifetimes, and emission anisotropies of several fluorophore protein conjugates have been studied in the absence and presence of metallic nanostructures. Despite highly decreased lifetimes of about 10-fold and immobilization of conjugates on the solid substrate, the observed emission anisotropies for all fluorophores on the metal-enhanced substrate decreased 300-500{\%} compared to that in solution. This observation implies a new generation of fluorescence polarization immunoassays with broad applications because of no restrictions to the lifetime of the probe and the size of labeled biomolecules. The changes in polarization are due to binding that occur on the bioactive surface localized near the metal particles.},

However, it is unclear to what extent the hydration water and protein are coupled and interact with each other. Here, we show by ESR experiments (cw, DEER, ESEEM, and ESE techniques) with spin-labeling and nanoconfinement techniques that the vitrified hydration layers can be evidently recognized in the ESR spectra, providing nanoscale understanding for the biological interfacial water. Two peptides of different secondary structures and lengths are studied in vitrified bulk solvents and in water-filled nanochannels of different pore diameter (6.1{\~{}}7.6 nm). The existence of surface hydration and bulk shells are demonstrated. Water in the immediate vicinity of the nitroxide label (within the van der Waals contacts, {\~{}}0.35 nm) at the water-peptide interface is verified to be non-crystalline at 50 K, and the water accessibility changes little with the nanochannel dimension. Nevertheless, this water accessibility for the nanochannel cases is only half the value for the bulk solvent, even though the peptide structures remain largely the same as those immersed in the bulk solvents. On the other hand, the hydration density in the range of {\~{}}2 nm from the nitroxide spin increases substantially with decreasing pore size, as the density for the largest pore size (7.6 nm) is comparable to that for the bulk solvent. The results demonstrate that while the peptides are confined but structurally unaltered in the nanochannels, their surrounding water exhibits density heterogeneity along the peptide surface normal. The causes and implications, especially those involving the interactions between the first hydration water and peptides, of these observations are discussed. Spin-label ESR techniques are proven useful for studying the structure and influences of interfacial hydration.},

Recently, new cavities on Ras for small-molecule ligands were identified, and selective direct targeting of mutated K-Ras(G12C) has become possible for what is to our knowledge the first time. In addition, impairment of Ras spatial organization, in particular via targeting the prenyl-binding Ras chaperone PDE$\delta$, has opened a fresh perspective in anticancer research.

Mn-depletion or Ca(2+)-depletion causes extension of the lifetime of tyrosine radical Y(Z)(*), which can be trapped by rapid freezing after illumination at about 250 K. Above pH 6.5, Y(Z)(*) radical in Mn-depleted PS II shows similar EPR and ENDOR spectra similar to that of Y(D)(*) radical, which are ascribed to a typical neutral tyrosine radical. Below pH 6.5, Y(Z)(*) radical shows quite different EPR and ENDOR spectra. ENDOR spectra show the spin density distribution of the low-pH form of Y(Z)(*) that has been quite different from the high-pH form of Y(Z)(*). The spin density distribution of the low-pH Y(Z)(*) can be explained by a cation radical or the neutral radical induced by strong electrostatic interaction. The pH dependence of the activation energy of the recombination rate between Y(Z)(*) and Q(A)(-) shows a gap of 4.4 kJ/mol at pH 6.0-6.5. In the Ca(2+)-depleted PS II, Y(Z)(*) signal was the mixture of the cation-like and normal neutral radicals, and the pH dependence of Y(Z)(*) spectrum in Ca(2+)-depleted PS II is considerably different from the neutral radical found in Mn-depleted PS II. Based on the recent structure data of cyanobacterial PS II, the pH dependence of Y(Z)(*) could be ascribed to the modification of the local structure and hydrogen-bonding network induced by the dissociation of ASP170 near Y(Z).},

The distribution of 1H longitudinal relaxation times obtained by the inverse Laplace method was utilized to estimate the volume fraction of proton species as a function of relative humidity (RH). The relaxation time distribution clearly revealed two distinguished peaks on the order of 10–3 and 10–2 s, which corresponded to water in the larger and smaller channels for proton transports, respectively. We applied a pulse sequence to understand the water species by diffusion-weighted inversion recovery, which led to individual self-diffusion coefficients for deconvoluted water by using the longitudinal relaxation time. At 30{\%} RH, the diffusion coefficient of water in small-sized channels is greater than that in large-sized channels. On the other hand, the diffusion coefficients of protons with s...},

abstract = {The absolute perfusion and the intracapillary or regional blood volume (RBV) in murine myocardium were assessed in vivo by spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. Pixel-based perfusion and RBV maps were calculated at a pixel resolution of 469 x 469 mum and a slice thickness of 2 mm. The T(1) imaging module was a segmented inversion recovery snapshot fast low angle shot sequence with velocity compensation in all three gradient directions. The group average myocardial perfusion at baseline was determined to be 701 +/- 53 mL (100 g . min)(-1) for anesthesia with isoflurane (N = 11) at a mean heart rate (HR) of 455 +/- 10 beats per minute (bpm). This value is in good agreement with perfusion values determined by invasive microspheres examinations. For i.v. administration of the anesthetic Propofol, the baseline perfusion decreased to 383 +/- 40 mL (100 g . min)(-1) (N = 17, P {\textless} 0.05 versus. isoflurane) at a mean heart rate of 261 +/- 13 bpm (P {\textless} 0.05 versus isoflurane). In addition, six mice with myocardial infarction were studied under isoflurane anesthesia (HR 397 +/- 7 bpm). The perfusion maps showed a clear decrease of the perfusion in the infarcted area. The perfusion in the remote myocardium decreased significantly to 476 +/- 81 mL (100 g . min)(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05 versus sham). Regarding the regional blood volume, a mean value of 11.8 +/- 0.8 vol {\%} was determined for healthy murine myocardium under anesthesia with Propofol (N = 4, HR 233 +/- 17 bpm). In total, the presented techniques provide noninvasive in vivo assessment of the perfusion and the regional blood volume in the murine myocardium for the first time and seem to be promising tools for the characterization of mouse models in cardiovascular research.

QMPFF3 calculation of the hydrophobic effect is compared to that obtained with empirical force fields. Using a novel and highly sensitive method, we see polarization increases ordered water structure so that the imprint of the hydrophobic surface atoms on the surrounding waters is stronger and extends to long-range. We see less water order for empirical force fields. The greater order seen with QMPFF3 will affect biological processes through a stronger hydrophobic effect.},

When relaxation is driven by intermolecular dipolar interactions, the relevant spectral density functions (SDFs) also have significant contributions, in principle, from distant spins all over the dynamic range typically probed by NMR experiments such as NOESY. In this work, we investigate the intermolecular dipolar spin relaxation as driven by the relative diffusion of solvent and solute molecules taking place under a central force field, and we examine the relevant implications for (preferential) solvation studies. For this purpose, we evaluate the SDFs by employing a numerical approach based on spatial discretization of the time-propagation equation, and we supply an analytical solution for the simplest case of a steplike mean-field potential. Several situations related to different solute-solvent pair correlation functions are examined in terms of static/dynamic effects and relaxation modes, and some conclusions are drawn about the interpretation of NOE measurements. While we confirm previous results concerning the spoiling effect of long-range spins (Halle, B. J. Chem. Phys. 2003, 119, 12372), we also show that SDFs are sufficiently sensitive to pair correlation functions that useful, yet rather complicated, inferences can be made on the nature of the solvation shell.},

We tested the therapeutic potential of metabolic drugs in NSCLC and identified phenformin, a mitochondrial inhibitor and analog of the diabetes therapeutic metformin, as selectively inducing apoptosis in LKB1-deficient NSCLC cells. Therapeutic trials in Kras-dependent mouse models of NSCLC revealed that tumors with Kras and Lkb1 mutations, but not those with Kras and p53 mutations, showed selective response to phenformin as a single agent, resulting in prolonged survival. This study suggests phenformin as a cancer metabolism-based therapeutic to selectively target LKB1-deficient tumors.},

abstract = {Marked hydration changes occur during the self-assembly of the melittin protein tetramer in water. Hydrophobicity induces a drying transition in the gap between simple sufficiently large ( more than 1 nm(2)) strongly hydrophobic surfaces as they approach each other(1-6), resulting in the subsequent collapse of the system, as well as a depletion of water next to single surfaces(7-10). Here we investigate whether the hydrophobic induced collapse of multidomain proteins or the formation of protein oligimers exhibits a similar drying transition. We performed computer simulations to study the collapse of the tetramer of melittin in water, and observed a marked water drying transition inside a nanoscale channel of the tetramer ( with a channel size of up to two or three water-molecule diameters). This transition, although occurring on a microscopic length scale, is analogous to a first-order phase transition from liquid to vapour. We find that this drying is very sensitive to single mutations of the three isoleucines to less hydrophobic residues and that such mutations in the right locations can switch the channel from being dry to being wet. Thus, quite subtle changes in hydrophobic surface topology can profoundly influence the drying transition. We show that, even in the presence of the polar protein backbone, sufficiently hydrophobic protein surfaces can induce a liquid - vapour transition providing an enormous driving force towards further collapse. This behaviour was unexpected because of the absence of drying in the collapse of the multidomain protein 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (BphC).},

By comparing results from the free duplex with those from its complex with netropsin, water molecules in the "spine of hydration" in the AATT region of the minor groove could be distinguished from hydration water elsewhere in the duplex. The 2H and 17O relaxation dispersions yield a model-independent residence time of 0.9(+/-0.1) ns at 4 degrees C for five highly ordered water molecules in the spine. When corrected for frequency offset effects, the NOE data yield the same residence time as the NMRD data, giving credence to both methods. At 27 degrees C, the residence time is estimated to 0.2 ns, a factor of 40 shorter than the tumbling time of the duplex. The NMRD data show that all water molecules associated with the duplex, except the five molecules in the spine, have residence times significantly shorter than 1 ns at 4 degrees C. There is thus no long-lived hydration structure associated with the phosphate backbone. In contrast to 2H and 17O, the 1H relaxation dispersion is dominated by labile DNA protons and therefore provides little information about DNA hydration.},

The second reformulates the expressions describing the performance of an ESE spectrometer so that they can better apply to the samples of interest in our laboratory, frozen-solution metalloproteins whose broad EPR envelopes are determined byganisotropy. Some issues that play a central role in determining ESE performance, most especially for pulsed ENDOR, yet have not previously been described and are not quantifiable in straightforward ways, are also discussed. The third section presents Mims and Davies pulsed ENDOR and ESEEM applications and includes comparisons with a previously constructed X-band ESE spectrometer. When the same sample tube is used in both spectrometers (2.5 mm O.D. thin-walled quartz), for the applications discussed, the Q-band spectrometer exhibits sensitivity enhancements over X band that vary in understandable ways from about 10- to 3-fold, depending on the experiment.},

abstract = {Hydrophobic hydration is considered to have a key role in biological processes ranging from membrane formation to protein folding and ligand binding. Historically, hydrophobic hydration shells were thought to resemble solid clathrate hydrates, with solutes surrounded by polyhedral cages composed of tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded water molecules. But more recent experimental and theoretical studies have challenged this view and emphasized the importance of the length scales involved. Here we report combined polarized, isotopic and temperature-dependent Raman scattering measurements with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR) that explore hydrophobic hydration by mapping the vibrational spectroscopic features arising from the hydrophobic hydration shells of linear alcohols ranging from methanol to heptanol. Our data, covering the entire 0-100 °C temperature range, show clear evidence that at low temperatures the hydration shells have a hydrophobically enhanced water structure with greater tetrahedral order and fewer weak hydrogen bonds than the surrounding bulk water. This structure disappears with increasing temperature and is then, for hydrophobic chains longer than {\~{}}1 nm, replaced by a more disordered structure with weaker hydrogen bonds than bulk water. These observations support our current understanding of hydrophobic hydration, including the thermally induced water structural transformation that is suggestive of the hydrophobic crossover predicted to occur at lengths of {\~{}}1 nm (refs 5, 9, 10, 14).},

  abstract  = {Solvation in water requires minimizing the perturbations in its hydrogen bonded network. Hence solutes distort water molecular motions in a surrounding domain, forming a molecule-specific hydration shell. The properties of those hydration shells impact the structure and function of the solubilized molecules, both at the single molecule and at higher order levels. The size of the hydration shell and the picoseconds time-scale water dynamics retardation are revealed by terahertz (THz) absorption coefficient measurements. Room-temperature absorption coefficient at f = 0.28 [THz] is measured as a function of alcohol concentration in aqueous methanol, ethanol, 1,2-propanol, and 1-butanol solutions. Highly diluted alcohol measurements and enhanced overall measurement accuracy are achieved with a THz absorption measurement technique of nL-volume liquids in a capillary tube. In the absorption analysis, bulk and interfacial molecular domains of water and alcohol are considered. THz ideal and excess absorption coefficients are defined in accordance with thermodynamics mixing formulations. The parameter extraction method is developed based on a THz excess absorption model and hydrated solute molecule packing density representation. First, the hydration shell size is deduced from the hydrated solute packing densities at two specific THz excess absorption nonlinearity points: at infinite alcohol dilution (IAD) and at the THz excess absorption extremum (EAE). Consequently, interfacial water and alcohol molecular domain absorptions are deduced from the THz excess absorption model. The hydration shell sizes obtained at the THz excess absorption extremum are in excellent agreement with other reports. The hydration shells of methanol, ethanol, 1- and 2-propanol consist of 13.97, 22.94, 22.99, and 31.10 water molecules, respectively. The hydration shell water absorption is on average 0.774 ± 0.028 times the bulk water absorption. The hydration shell parameters might shed light on hydration dynamics of biomolecules.},

  abstract = {This study describes the use of the single-point imaging (SPI) modality, also known as constant-time imaging (CTI), in radiofrequency (RF) Fourier transform (FT) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The SPI technique, commonly used for high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, has been successfully applied to 2D and 3D RF-FT-EPR imaging of phantoms containing narrow-line EPR spin probes. The SPI scheme is essentially a phase-encoding technique that operates by acquiring a single data point in the free induction decay (FID) after a fixed delay (phase-encoding time), following the pulsed RF excitation, in the presence of static magnetic field gradients. Since the phase-encoding time remains constant for a given image data set, the spectral information is automatically deconvolved, providing well-resolved pure spatial images. Therefore, images obtained using SPI are artifact-free and the resolution is not significantly limited by the line width, compared to the images obtained using the conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) scheme, suggesting that the SPI modality may have advantages for EPR imaging of large objects. In this work the advantages and limitations of SPI as compared to FBP are investigated by imaging suitable phantom objects. Although SPI takes longer to perform than the FBP method, optimization of the data collection scheme may increase the temporal resolution, rendering this technique suitable for in vivo studies. Spectral information can also be extracted from a series of SPI images that are generated as a function of the delay from the excitation pulse.},

  abstract = {Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) in the liquid state has become the focus of attention to improve the NMR sensitivity of mass limited samples. The Overhauser model predicts a fast reduction in DNP enhancement at high magnetic fields where the Electron Larmor frequency exceeds the typical inverse correlation time of the magnetic interaction between a radical spin and proton spins of the water molecules. Recent experiments have shown that an appreciable DNP enhancement in the liquid state is possible also at magnetic fields of 3 to 9 Tesla. At present it is not clear whether the Overhauser model needs to be adapted to explain these results. In the present paper we aim to resolve this question by a combination of in situ temperature dependent NMR relaxation measurements, EPR and DNP experiments. Enhancement factors of up to -165 are obtained with microwave powers below 500 mW. We conclude that at 3.4 Tesla (95 GHz) the various measurements are consistent with each other and in quantitative agreement with Overhauser theory. Microwave heating of the sample does play an important role to reduce the correlation times and allow a substantial Overhauser DNP. The typical enhancement factors may allow new applications in microfluidic NMR.},

This data is characterised by the orientation dependence of the modulation depth parameter and of the dipolar frequencies. This dependence has to be taken into account in the data analysis in order to extract distance distributions accurately from the experimental time traces. In this work, a fitting algorithm for such data analysis is discussed. The approach is tested on PELDOR data-sets from the literature and is compared with the previous results.},

The spheres had a mean diameter of 100 microm, thus providing an approximately constant characteristic pore dimension throughout the structures, while the use of two glass types ensured that water in different pore-space regions had significantly different T(2) relaxation rates. The packed beds were constructed in various ways with controlled glass type domain sizes to rigorously validate a model for region-to-region exchange of water. From the determined exchange times, the corresponding length scales were calculated based on the molecular self-diffusion of water; these agreed to better than +/-25{\%} with the expected domain sizes. Furthermore, exchange distances on the order of the pore size were observed in thoroughly mixed systems. Depending on the relaxation rates present in the sample, this technique can provide estimates of length scales ranging from microns to millimeters.},

The results show changes in the plasticity of the hydrogen-bond network of hydration water molecules depending on the biomolecular site. At 200 K, the measured low frequency density of states of hydration water molecules of hydrophilic peptides is remarkably similar to that of high density amorphous ice, whereas, for hydrophobic biomolecules, it is comparable to that of low density amorphous ice behavior. In both hydrophilic and hydrophobic biomolecules, the high frequency modes show a blue shift of the libration mode as compared to the room temperature data. These results can be related to the density of water molecules around the biological interface, suggesting that the apparent local density of water is larger in a hydrophilic environment.},

  abstract  = {The importance of membrane-based compartmentalization in eukaryotic cell function has become broadly appreciated, and a number of studies indicate that these eukaryotic cell membranes contain coexisting liquid-ordered (L(o)) and liquid-disordered (L(d)) lipid domains. However, the current evidence for such phase separation is indirect, and so far there has been no direct demonstration of differences in the ordering and dynamics for the lipids in these two types of regions or their relative amounts in the plasma membranes of live cells. In this study, we provide direct evidence for the presence of two different types of lipid populations in the plasma membranes of live cells from four different cell lines by electron spin resonance. Analysis of the electron spin resonance spectra recorded over a range of temperatures, from 5 to 37 degrees C, shows that the spin-labeled phospholipids incorporated experience two types of environments, L(o) and L(d), with distinct order parameters and rotational diffusion coefficients but with some differences among the four cell lines. These results suggest that coexistence of lipid domains that differ significantly in their dynamic order in the plasma membrane is a general phenomenon. The L(o) region is found to be a major component in contrast to a model in which small liquid-ordered lipid rafts exist in a 'sea' of disordered lipids. The results on ordering and dynamics for the live cells are also compared with those from model membranes exhibiting coexisting L(o) and L(d) phases.},

  abstract   = {Water engages in two important types of interactions near biomolecules: it forms ordered ``cages'' around exposed hydrophobic regions, and it participates in hydrogen bonds with surface polar groups. Both types of interaction are critical to biomolecular structure and function, but explicitly including an appropriate number of solvent molecules makes many applications computationally intractable. A number of implicit solvent models have been developed to address this problem, many of which treat these two solvation effects separately. Here, we describe a new model to capture polar solvation effects, called SHO (``solvent hydrogen-bond occlusion''); our model aims to directly evaluate the energetic penalty associated with displacing discrete first-shell water molecules near each solute polar group. We have incorporated SHO into the Rosetta energy function, and find that scoring protein structures with SHO provides superior performance in loop modeling, virtual screening, and protein structure prediction benchmarks. These improvements stem from the fact that SHO accurately identifies and penalizes polar groups that do not participate in hydrogen bonds, either with solvent or with other solute atoms (``unsatisfied'' polar groups). We expect that in future, SHO will enable higher-resolution predictions for a variety of molecular modeling applications. $\backslash$textcopyright{\{}{\}}2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

With this enhanced stability, we overcame the traditional need to scan rapidly while imaging and achieved a 5-fold increase in the image signal-to-noise ratio.

The stabilization technique requires low laser power ({\textless}1 mW), imparts a minimal perturbation upon the cantilever, and is independent of the tip-sample interaction.

The {\textless} k(2 {\textgreater}) is found to deviate significantly from the theoretical value and high correlation between the orientation factor kappa and the distance R is observed. The correlation is quantified using several possible fixed A orientations and correlation as high as 0.80 is found between kappa and R and as high as 0.68 between kappa(2) and R.

The correlation results in the quantities {\textless}kappa R-2(-6){\textgreater} and {\textless}kappa(2 {\textgreater}) {\textless} R-6 {\textgreater} differing by a factor of 1.6.

The enhanced g-tensor resolution of 250-GHz ESR for these spin labels permitted a careful study of the nitroxide g-tensor as a function of spin probe location and membrane composition. In particular, as the spin label is displaced from the polar head group, Azz decreases and gxx increases as they assume values typical of a nonpolar environment, appropriate for the hydrophobic alkyl chains in the case of pure lipid dispersions. The field shifts of spectral features due to changes in gxx are an order of magnitude larger than those from changes in Azz. The magnetic tensor parameters measured in the presence of GA were characteristic of a polar environment and showed only a very weak dependence of Azz and gxx on label position. These results demonstrate the significant influence of GA on the local polarity along the lipid molecule, and may reflect increased penetration of water into the alkyl chain region of the lipid in the presence of GA. The spectra from the pure lipid dispersions also exhibit a broad background signal that is most significant for 7-, 10-, and 12-PC, and is more pronounced in DPPC than in POPC. It is attributed to spin probe aggregation yielding spin exchange narrowing. The addition of GA to DPPC essentially suppressed the broad background signal observed in pure DPPC dispersions.},

The resulting D(t)(ϕ) is described by short-time self-diffusion of effective spheres. Protein self-diffusion at biological volume fractions is found to be slowed down to 20{\%} of the dilute limit solely due to hydrodynamic interactions.},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional (2D) experiment that correlates electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) frequencies, useful for unraveling and assigning ENDOR and ESEEM spectra from different paramagnetic centers with overlapping EPR spectra, is presented. The pulse sequence employed is similar to the Davies ENDOR experiment with the exception that the two-pulse echo detection is replaced by a stimulated echo detection in order to enhance the resolution in the ESEEM dimension. The two-dimensional data set is acquired by measuring the ENDOR spectrum as a function of the time interval T between the last two microwave pulses of the stimulated echo detection scheme. This produces a series of ENDOR spectra with amplitudes that are modulated with T. Fourier transformation (FT) with respect to T then generates a 2D spectrum with cross peaks connecting spectral lines of the ESEEM and ENDOR spectra that belong to the same paramagnetic center. Projections along the vertical and horizontal axes give the three-pulse FT-ESEEM and ENDOR spectra, respectively. The feasibility of the experiment was tested by simulating 2D ENDOR-ESEEM correlation spectra of a system consisting of an electron spin (S = 12) coupled to two nuclei (I1 = I2 = 12), taking into account experimental conditions such as pulse durations and off-resonance irradiation frequencies. The experiment is demonstrated on a single crystal of Cu2+ doped l-histidine (Cu-His), containing two symmetrically related Cu2+ sites that at an arbitrary orientation exhibit overlapping ESEEM and ENDOR spectra. While the ESEEM spectrum is relatively simple and arises primarily from one weakly coupled 14N, the ENDOR spectrum is very crowded due to contributions from two nonequivalent nitrogens, two chlorides, and a relatively large number of protons. The simple ESEEM projection of the 2D ENDOR-ESEEM correlation spectrum is then used to disentangle the ENDOR spectrum and resolve two sets of lines corresponding to the different sites.},

The spectrometer consisting of a high-frequency high-power solid-state source, a quasioptical system, a phase-sensitive detection system, a cryogenic-free superconducting magnet, and a (4)He cryostat enables multi-frequency continuous-wave EPR spectroscopy as well as pulsed EPR measurements with a few hundred nanosecond pulses.

  abstract   = {The first part of this paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven threshold for image denoising via wavelet soft-thresholding. The threshold is derived in a Bayesian framework, and the prior used on the wavelet coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely used in image processing applications. The proposed threshold is simple and closed-form, and it is adaptive to each subband because it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method, called BayesShrink, is typically within 5{\%} of the MSE of the best soft-thresholding benchmark with the image assumed known. It also outperforms SureShrink (Donoho and Johnstone 1994, 1995; Donoho 1995) most of the time. The second part of the paper attempts to further validate claims that lossy compression can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising, and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically, the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining coder design parameters are chosen based on a criterion derived from Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle. Experiments show that this compression method does indeed remove noise significantly, especially for large noise power. However, it introduces quantization noise and should be used only if bitrate were an additional concern to denoising.},

abstract = {Spatially resolved impedance spectroscopy of a Nafion polyelectrolyte membrane is performed employing a conductive and Pt-coated tip of an atomic force microscope as a point-like contact and electrode. The experiment is conducted by perturbing the system by a rectangular voltage step and measuring the incurred current, followed by Fourier transformation and plotting the impedance against the frequency in a conventional Bode diagram. To test the potential and limitations of this novel method, we present a feasibility study using an identical hydrogen atmosphere at a well-defined relative humidity on both sides of the membrane. It is demonstrated that good quality impedance spectra are obtained in a frequency range of 0.2-1,000 Hz. The extracted polarization curves exhibit a maximum current which cannot be explained by typical diffusion effects. Simulation based on equivalent circuits requires a Nernst element for restricted diffusion in the membrane which suggests that this effect is based on the potential dependence of the electrolyte resistance in the high overpotential region.},

We identify two HAMP conformations distinguished by a four- to two-helix packing transition at the C-termini that send opposing signals in bacterial chemoreceptors. Crystal structures of signal-locked mutants establish the observed structure-to-function relationships. Pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy of spin-labeled soluble receptors active in cells verify that the crystallographically defined HAMP conformers are maintained in the receptors and influence the structure and activity of downstream domains accordingly. Mutation of HR2, a key residue for setting the HAMP conformation and generating an inhibitory signal, shifts HAMP structure and receptor output to an activating state. Another HR2 variant displays an inverted response with respect to ligand and demonstrates the fine energetic balance between "on" and "off" conformers. A DExG motif found in membrane proximal HAMP domains is shown to be critical for responses to extracellular ligand. Our findings directly correlate in vivo signaling with HAMP structure, stability, and dynamics to establish a comprehensive model for HAMP-mediated signal relay that consolidates existing views on how conformational signals propagate in receptors. Moreover, we have developed a rational means to manipulate HAMP structure and function that may prove useful in the engineering of bacterial taxis responses.},

abstract = {Computer simulations are a powerful way of understanding molecular systems, especially those that are difficult to probe experimentally. How ever, to fully realize their potential, we need methods that can provide understanding, make a quantitative connection with experiment, and drive efficient simulations. The main purpose of this book is to introduce Markov state models (MSMs) and demonstrate that they meet all three of these requirements. In short, MSMs are network models that provide a map of the free energy landscape that ultimately determines a molecule's structure and dynamics. These maps can be used to understand a system, predict experiments, or decide where to run new simulations to refine themap. Protein folding and function will often be used to illustrate the prin- ciples in this book as these problems have largely driven the development of MSMs; however, the methods are equally applicable to other molecu- lar systems and possibly entirely different prob- lems. Whether you are an experimentalist inter- ested in understanding a bit of theory and how it could complement your work or a theorist seek- ing to understand the details of thesemethods,we hope this book will be useful to you. This introduction provides a brief overview of the background leading to the development of MSMs, what MSMs are, and the contents of this book.},

ESEEM spectra are recorded as two-dimensional correlation experiments, since the full digitization of the electron spin echo provides an additional Fourier transform EPR dimension. Thus, UWB hyperfine-sublevel correlation experiments generate a novel three-dimensional EPR-correlated nuclear modulation spectrum.},

This is possible by synchronizing few-$\mu$s 2$\omega$(0) pulses with an NMR line-narrowing sequence, which averages the Stark interaction to dominate spectra on a background with 10(3)× enhanced resolution. Spectra vs ϕ(E) reveal relative sizes of tensorial factors in H(Q). Comparative modeling and numerical simulations evaluate spectral features unexplained by average Hamiltonian theory, and suggest improvements for quantitative calibration of individual response components. Application of this approach to bulk samples is of value to define Stark responses that may later be used to interrogate the internal electrostatics of structured samples.},

There is a long-standing enigma as to when, where, and how the two substrate water molecules bind to the Mn4OxCa cluster during the cyclic water-splitting reaction, which involves five distinct redox intermediates (Si-states; i = 0,...,4). To address this question we employed hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopy on H217O-enriched PSII samples poised in the paramagnetic S2 state. This approach allowed us to resolve the magnetic interaction between one solvent exchangeable 17O that is directly ligated to one or more Mn ions of the Mn4OxCa cluster in the S2 state of PSII. Direct coordination of 17O to Mn is supported by the strong (A approximately 10 MHz) hyperfine coupling. Because these are properties expected from a substrate water molecule, this spectroscopic signature holds the potential for gaining long-sought information about the binding mode and site of one of the two substrate water molecules in the S2 state of PSII.},

  abstract  = {This work is focused on the two more expressed human myoglobin isoforms. In the literature, their different overexpression in high-altitude natives was proposed to be related to alternative/complementary functions in hypoxia. Interestingly, they differ only at residue-54, lysine or glutamate, which is external and far from the main binding site. In order to ascertain whether these two almost identical myoglobins might exert different functions and to contribute to a deeper understanding about myoglobin's oxygen-level dependent functioning, they have been compared with respect to dynamics, heme electronic structure, and NO reactivity at different O2 levels. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate the electronic structure of the nitrosyl-form, obtaining fundamental clues about a different bond interaction between the heme-iron and the proximal histidine and highlighting striking differences in NO reactivity, especially at a very low pO2. The experimental results well matched with the information provided by molecular dynamics simulations, which showed a significantly different dynamics for the two proteins only in the absence of O2. The single mutation differentiating the two myoglobins resulted in strongly affecting the plasticity of the CD-region (C-helix-loop-D-helix), whose fluctuations, being coupled to the solvent, were found to be correlated with the dynamics of the distal binding site. In the absence of O2, on the one hand a significantly different probability for the histidine-gate opening has been shown by MD simulations, and on the other a different yield of myoglobin-NO formation was experimentally observed through EPR.},

  abstract = {Central to structural studies of biomolecules are multidimensional experiments. These are lengthy to record due to the requirement to sample the full Nyquist grid. Time savings can be achieved through undersampling the indirectly-detected dimensions combined with non-Fourier Transform (FT) processing, provided the experimental signal-to-noise ratio is sufficient. Alternatively, resolution and signal-to-noise can be improved within a given experiment time. However, non-FT based reconstruction of undersampled spectra that encompass a wide signal dynamic range is strongly impeded by the non-linear behaviour of many methods, which further compromises the detection of weak peaks. Here we show, through an application to a larger $\alpha$-helical membrane protein under crowded spectral conditions, the potential use of compressed sensing (CS) l (1)-norm minimization to reconstruct undersampled 3D NOESY spectra. Substantial signal overlap and low sensitivity make this a demanding application, which strongly benefits from the improvements in signal-to-noise and resolution per unit time achieved through the undersampling approach. The quality of the reconstructions is assessed under varying conditions. We show that the CS approach is robust to noise and, despite significant spectral overlap, is able to reconstruct high quality spectra from data sets recorded in far less than half the amount of time required for regular sampling.},

The second and third preparations, but not the first, are depleted of the peripheral 17 and 23 kD polypeptides associated with the OEC. It has been proposed that depletion of these polypeptides increases the exposure of OEC manganese to the aqueous phase. The NMR-PRE response measures the quantity (T1m+$\tau$m)(-1), where T1m is the spin relaxation time and $\tau$m is the mean residence time with respect to chemical exchange reactions of solvent protons in the manganese coordination sphere, and, thus, the NMR-PRE provides a direct measure of the solvent proton chemical exchange rate constant $\tau$m (-1). This study tested whether the 17 and 23 kD polypeptides shield the OEC from the solvent phase and whether their depletion enhances the S2 and S0 NMR-PRE signals by removing a kinetic barrier to the solvent proton chemical exchange reaction. The amplitude of the S2 NMR-PRE signal, measured in its chemical exchange-limited regime ($\tau$m{\textgreater}T1m), is slightly decreased, rather than increased, in preparations (2) and (3) relative to (1), indicating that removal of the 17 and 23 kD polypeptides slightly slows, rather than accelerates, the rate-limiting steps of the solvent proton chemical exchange reactions. In addition, the lifetime of the S2 state was shortened several-fold in the solubilized PS II complex and in salt-washed TMF-2 membranes relative to untreated TMF-2 control samples. The S0 NMR-PRE signal, which is present in TMF-2 suspensions, was not detected in suspensions of the solubilized PS II complex, even though these samples contained high concentrations of active manganese centers (approximately double those of the TMF-2 control) and exhibited an S2 NMR-PRE signal of comparable amplitude to that of the TMF-2 preparation. These results suggest that the 17 and 23 kD extrinsic polypeptides do not shield the NMR-visible water binding site in the OEC from the aqueous phase, although their removal substantially alters the proton relaxation efficiency by shortening T1m.},

  abstract   = {Proteorhodopsins (PRs), photoactive retinylidene membrane proteins ubiquitous in marine eubacteria, exhibit light-driven proton transport activity similar to that of the well studied bacteriorhodopsin from halophilic archaea. However, unlike bacteriorhodopsin, PRs have a single highly conserved histidine located near the photoactive site of the protein. Time-resolved Fourier transform IR difference spectroscopy combined with visible absorption spectroscopy, isotope labeling, and electrical measurements of light-induced charge movements reveal participation of His-75 in the proton translocation mechanism of PR. Substitution of His-75 with Ala or Glu perturbed the structure of the photoactive site and resulted in significantly shifted visible absorption spectra. In contrast, His-75 substitution with a positively charged Arg did not shift the visible absorption spectrum of PR. The mutation to Arg also blocks the light-induced proton transfer from the Schiff base to its counterion Asp-97 during the photocycle and the acid-induced protonation of Asp-97 in the dark state of the protein. Isotope labeling of histidine revealed that His-75 undergoes deprotonation during the photocycle in the proton-pumping (high pH) form of PR, a reaction further supported by results from H75E. Finally, all His-75 mutations greatly affect charge movements within the PR and shift its pH dependence to acidic values. A model of the proteorhodopsin proton transport process is proposed as follows: (i) in the dark state His-75 is positively charged (protonated) over a wide pH range and interacts directly with the Schiff base counterion Asp-97; and (ii) photoisomerization-induced transfer of the Schiff base proton to the Asp-97 counterion disrupts its interaction with His-75 and triggers a histidine deprotonation.},

The investigation was carried out by combining a range of techniques such as circular dichroic (CD) spectroscopy, steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and transmission electron microscopy. The influence of microviscosity induced by IL-emes on the secondary structure of $\beta$LG was studied using a quartz crystal microbalance and correlated with the steady-state fluorescence emission. The effect of heat on the helix-beta transition in $\beta$LG was directly measured by ITC by titrating $\beta$LG with IL-emes. The net effect of heat after subtraction of the heat of dilution was negative in both cases, suggesting that the protein moves to a stable conformation. The changes in the overall aggregated structures were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, where a shift in the size and morphology of aggregates was found, from large clusters (size of 70 nm) at pH 4 to smaller aggregates (size of 20 nm) at pH 7.5, which reduced to 7 nm in the presence of the IL. The transformation of helical to beta structure at pH 4 show that the folding pathway in the presence of the ionic liquid is hierarchical, whereas at neutral pH, it appeared to be nonhierarchical and the final native structure was acquired by nonlocal interactions through typical forces involved in the stabilization of the tertiary structure.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated experimentally the possibility of modulating protein activity by low intensity microwaves by measuring alternations of L: -Lactate Dehydrogenase enzyme (LDH) activity. The LDH enzyme solutions were irradiated by microwaves of the selected frequencies and powers using the Transverse Electro-Magnetic (TEM) cell. The kinetics of the irradiated LDH was measured by continuous monitoring of nicotine adenine dinucleotide, reduced (NADH) absorbance at 340 nm. A comparative analysis of changes in the activity of the irradiated LDH enzyme versus the non-radiated enzyme was performed for the selected frequencies and powers. It was found that LDH activity can be selectively increased only by irradiation at the particular frequencies of 500 MHz [electric field: 0.02 V/m (1.2 × 10⁻⁶ W/m²)-2.1 V/m (1.2 × 10⁻² W/m²)] and 900 MHz [electric field: 0.021-0.21 V/m (1.2 × 10⁻⁴ W/m²)]. Based on results obtained it was concluded that LDH enzyme activity can be modulated by specific frequencies of low power microwave radiation. This finding can serve to support the hypothesis that low intensity microwaves can induce non-thermal effects in bio-molecules.},

  abstract = {Directly targeting oncogenic V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-Ras) with small-molecule inhibitors has historically been considered prohibitively challenging. Recent reports of compounds that bind directly to the K-Ras G12C mutant suggest avenues to overcome key obstacles that stand in the way of developing such compounds. We aim to target the guanine nucleotide (GN)-binding pocket because the natural contents of this pocket dictate the signaling state of K-Ras. Here, we characterize the irreversible inhibitor SML-8-73-1 (SML), which targets the GN-binding pocket of K-Ras G12C. We report a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of G12C K-Ras bound to SML, revealing that the compound binds in a manner similar to GDP, forming a covalent linkage with Cys-12. The resulting conformation renders K-Ras in the open, inactive conformation, which is not predicted to associate productively with or activate downstream effectors. Conservation analysis of the Ras family GN-binding pocket reveals variability in the side chains surrounding the active site and adjacent regions, especially in the switch I region. This variability may enable building specificity into new iterations of Ras and other GTPase inhibitors. High-resolution in situ chemical proteomic profiling of SML confirms that SML effectively discriminates between K-Ras G12C and other cellular GTP-binding proteins. A biochemical assay provides additional evidence that SML is able to compete with millimolar concentrations of GTP and GDP for the GN-binding site.},

  abstract      = {PURPOSE: An innovative, noninvasive, low-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy method was applied and adapted to investigate the integrity of multilamellar liposomes from hydrogenated phospholipids after subcutaneous injection in living mice. Moreover, the fate of the injected liposomal preparations was examined, as well as the possibility to achieve a depot effect. METHODS: Highly concentrated solutions of the spin probe 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-trimethylammoniumpiperidine-1-oxyl-iodide (CAT-1; 138 mM) were encapsulated in liposomes. They were characterized by laser diffraction, and the liberation of spin probe was investigated by ESR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Line shape changes allowed the differentiation between encapsulated and released CAT-1 after subcutaneous injection of liposomes. Multilamellar liposomes form a local depot at the site of injection. A sustained release of the spin probe from the depot was monitored by means of ESR. Whereas 40{\%} of the spin probe was released within the first 96 h after administration, 60{\%} remained in intact liposomes under the skin. No depot formation could be observed after injection of CAT-1 solutions, but a fast signal decrease due to systemic distribution and bioreduction of the nitroxide spin probe. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive analysis of liposomal integrity in living animals was successfully accomplished using a new L-Band ESR spectroscopy method. The liberation of CAT-1 from liposomes in vitro and in vivo was monitored by changes in the lineshape of ESR spectra and Heisenberg spin exchange. The significance of liposomal integrity for the formation of a localized drug depot effect was proved.},

The contributions to the homogeneous relaxation time, T2, from the overall and/or the internal rotations of the nitroxide is elucidated from the COSY spectra. The use of pure absorption spectra allows the variation of T2 across the spectrum to be monitored.

It is shown that at higher temperatures the principal mechanism for the formation of SD cross-peaks is the slow reorientation of the molecule, which modulates the 14N hf and g tensor interactions. A procedure is shown for extracting a correlation time, $\tau$c, by monitoring this growth of SD cross-peaks, which is in good agreement with theory. An anomalous temperature dependence of the experimental $\tau$c, at very low temperatures, is tentatively attributed to the fast internal rotations of the methyl groups on the nitroxide, which leads to spin-flips of the protons on these methyl groups.

The NALMA-water system and the QENS data together provide a unique study for characterizing the dynamics of different hydration layers near a prototypical hydrophobic side chain and the backbone of which it is attached. We observe several unexpected features in the dynamics of these biological solutions under ambient conditions. The NALMA dynamics shows evidence of de Gennes narrowing, an indication of coherent long timescale structural relaxation dynamics. The translational and rotational water dynamics at the highest solute concentrations are found to be highly suppressed as characterized by long residential time and slow diffusion coefficients. The analysis of the more dilute concentration solutions models the first hydration shell with the 2.0 M spectra. We find that for outer layer hydration dynamics that the translational diffusion dynamics is still suppressed, although the rotational relaxation time and residential time are converged to bulk-water values. Molecular dynamics analysis of the first hydration shell water dynamics shows spatially heterogeneous water dynamics, with fast water motions near the hydrophobic side chain, and much slower water motions near the hydrophilic backbone. We discuss the hydration dynamics results of this model protein system in the context of protein function and protein-protein recognition.},

Perdeuterated [N-15] TEMPOL and CTPO in glycerol-water mixtures and spin-labeled hemoglobin were studied using the time domain technique of pulsed saturation recovery electron double resonance (SR-ELDOR) in the 0.1-10-mus motional time regime. The signal from the SR-EPR experiment (in which the pump and observer frequencies are the same) consists of a multiexponential decay, the amplitudes of all of the components being of the same sign. The SR-ELDOR technique of pumping one spin manifold or orientation and observing at another changes the sign of the amplitude of one or more of the components of the decay. The electron spin lattice relaxation rate (T1e-1), the nitrogen nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (T1n-1), and the characteristic rotational correlation rate (tau(R)-1) are measured directly, and independently, using a multicomponent exponential global analysis method. It was not possible, in general, to separate the three desired rates from one another with SR-EPR experiments alone. Pooling the SR-EPR and SR-ELDOR decay curves spectra was essential for success.},

  abstract = {To efficiently deliver isotope-labeled proteins into mammalian cells poses a main challenge for structural and functional analysis by in-cell NMR. In this study we have employed cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to deliver the ALS-associated protein superoxide dismutase (SOD1) into HeLa cells. Our results show that, although full-length SOD1 cannot be efficiently internalized, a variant in which the active-site loops IV and VII have been truncated (SOD1($\Delta$IV$\Delta$VII)) yields high cytosolic delivery. The reason for the enhanced delivery of SOD1($\Delta$IV$\Delta$VII) seems to be the elimination of negatively charged side chains, which alters the net charge of the CPP-SOD1 complex from neutral to +4. The internalized SOD1($\Delta$IV$\Delta$VII) protein displays high-resolution in-cell NMR spectra similar to, but not identical to, those of the lysate of the cells. Spectral differences are found mainly in the dynamic $\beta$ strands 4, 5, and 7, triggered by partial protonation of the His moieties of the Cu-binding site. Accordingly, SOD1($\Delta$IV$\Delta$VII) doubles here as an internal pH probe, revealing cytosolic acidification under the experimental treatment. Taken together, these observations show that CPP delivery, albeit inefficient at first trials, can be tuned by protein engineering to allow atomic-resolution NMR studies of specific protein structures that have evaded other in-cell NMR approaches: in this case, the structurally elusive apoSOD1 barrel implicated as precursor for misfolding in ALS.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy can probe structural dynamics under thermal equilibrium conditions on time scales ranging from femtoseconds to approximately 100 ps and longer. One of the important uses of 2D-IR spectroscopy is to monitor the dynamical evolution of a molecular system by reporting the time dependent frequency fluctuations of an ensemble of vibrational probes. The vibrational frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) is the connection between the experimental observables and the microscopic molecular dynamics and is thus the central object of interest in studying dynamics with 2D-IR vibrational echo spectroscopy. A new observable is presented that greatly simplifies the extraction of the FFCF from experimental data. The observable is the inverse of the center line slope (CLS) of the 2D spectrum. The CLS is the inverse of the slope of the line that connects the maxima of the peaks of a series of cuts through the 2D spectrum that are parallel to the frequency axis associated with the first electric field-matter interaction. The CLS varies from a maximum of 1 to 0 as spectral diffusion proceeds. It is shown analytically to second order in time that the CLS is the T(w) (time between pulses 2 and 3) dependent part of the FFCF. The procedure to extract the FFCF from the CLS is described, and it is shown that the T(w) independent homogeneous contribution to the FFCF can also be recovered to yield the full FFCF. The method is demonstrated by extracting FFCFs from families of calculated 2D-IR spectra and the linear absorption spectra produced from known FFCFs. Sources and magnitudes of errors in the procedure are quantified, and it is shown that in most circumstances, they are negligible. It is also demonstrated that the CLS is essentially unaffected by Fourier filtering methods (apodization), which can significantly increase the efficiency of data acquisition and spectral resolution, when the apodization is applied along the axis used for obtaining the CLS and is symmetrical about tau=0. The CLS is also unchanged by finite pulse durations that broaden 2D spectra.},

  abstract = {Modern pulse EPR experiments are routinely used to study the structural features of paramagnetic centers. They are usually performed at low temperatures, where relaxation times are long and polarization is high, to achieve a sufficient Signal/Noise Ratio (SNR). However, when working with samples whose amount and/or concentration are limited, sensitivity becomes an issue and therefore measurements may require a significant accumulation time, up to 12h or more. As the detection scheme of practically all pulse EPR sequences is based on the integration of a spin echo--either primary, stimulated or refocused--a considerable increase in SNR can be obtained by replacing the single echo detection scheme by a train of echoes. All these echoes, generated by Carr-Purcell type sequences, are integrated and summed together to improve the SNR. This scheme is commonly used in NMR and here we demonstrate its applicability to a number of frequently used pulse EPR experiments: Echo-Detected EPR, Davies and Mims ENDOR (Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance), DEER (Electron-Electron Double Resonance|) and EDNMR (Electron-Electron Double Resonance (ELDOR)-Detected NMR), which were combined with a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) type detection scheme at W-band. By collecting the transient signal and integrating a number of refocused echoes, this detection scheme yielded a 1.6-5 folds SNR improvement, depending on the paramagnetic center and the pulse sequence applied. This improvement is achieved while keeping the experimental time constant and it does not introduce signal distortion.},

We have previously found that the deactivating effects of salts on proteins can be correlated to an indicator of ion hydration, the B-viscosity coefficient of the anion in solution. Here, we test the influence of cations on protein kinetic stability by observing deactivation of mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) in ammonium, caesium and chloride salt solutions, and we find that mRFP deactivation does not depend on cation hydration. We also measure mRFP deactivation in solutions containing denaturants (guanidinium chloride or urea) or stabilizing co-solutes (glycerol or sucrose) frequently encountered in many protein formulations to test whether hydration of these co-solutes can be used to indicate their relative effects on protein kinetic stability. We find that mRFP deactivation in solutions containing kosmotropic salts or stabilizers reaches a limiting rate and that hydration of denaturants is not an indicator of their denaturing strength.},

  abstract      = {There are a number of methods that can be used for the preparation of enzyme-containing lipid vesicles (liposomes) which are lipid dispersions that contain water-soluble enzymes in the trapped aqueous space. This has been shown by many investigations carried out with a variety of enzymes. A review of these studies is given and some of the main results are summarized. With respect to the vesicle-forming amphiphiles used, most preparations are based on phosphatidylcholine, either the natural mixtures obtained from soybean or egg yolk, or chemically defined compounds, such as DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) or POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). Charged enzyme-containing lipid vesicles are often prepared by adding a certain amount of a negatively charged amphiphile (typically dicetylphosphate) or a positively charged lipid (usually stearylamine). The presence of charges in the vesicle membrane may lead to an adsorption of the enzyme onto the interior or exterior site of the vesicle bilayers. If (i) the high enzyme encapsulation efficiencies; (ii) avoidance of the use of organic solvents during the entrapment procedure; (iii) relatively monodisperse spherical vesicles of about 100 nm diameter; and (iv) a high degree of unilamellarity are required, then the use of the so-called 'dehydration-rehydration method', followed by the 'extrusion technique' has shown to be superior over other procedures. In addition to many investigations in the field of cheese production--there are several studies on the (potential) medical and biomedical applications of enzyme-containing lipid vesicles (e.g. in the enzyme-replacement therapy or for immunoassays)--including a few in vivo studies. In many cases, the enzyme molecules are expected to be released from the vesicles at the target site, and the vesicles in these cases serve as the carrier system. For (potential) medical applications as enzyme carriers in the blood circulation, the preparation of sterically stabilized lipid vesicles has proven to be advantageous. Regarding the use of enzyme-containing vesicles as submicrometer-sized nanoreactors, substrates are added to the bulk phase. Upon permeation across the vesicle bilayer(s), the trapped enzymes inside the vesicles catalyze the conversion of the substrate molecules into products. Using physical (e.g. microwave irradiation) or chemical methods (e.g. addition of micelle-forming amphiphiles at sublytic concentration), the bilayer permeability can be controlled to a certain extent. A detailed molecular understanding of these (usually) submicrometer-sized bioreactor systems is still not there. There are only a few approaches towards a deeper understanding and modeling of the catalytic activity of the entrapped enzyme molecules upon externally added substrates. Using micrometer-sized vesicles (so-called 'giant vesicles') as simple models for the lipidic matrix of biological cells, enzyme molecules can be microinjected inside individual target vesicles, and the corresponding enzymatic reaction can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy using appropriate fluorogenic substrate molecules.},

The algorithm generates peak lists with precise chemical shift and integral intensities, and a reliability measure for the recognition of each peak. The results of automated peak picking of NOESY spectra with AUTOPSY were tested in combination with the combined automated NOESY cross peak assignment and structure calculation routine NOAH implemented in the program DYANA. The quality of the resulting structures was found to be comparable with those from corresponding data obtained with manual peak picking.},

Two new DNP probes were designed for electromagnets operating at a field of 1.4 T. In one probe, DNP can be combined with CPMAS. Compared to a similar probe reported previously, the main advantage of the new probe is the capability to spin vacuum-sealed samples with an improved filling factor. A second probe is based on an oversize microwave cavity. In this probe, large DNP enhancement factors can be obtained in nonlossy samples, e.g., a 1H enhancement factor of 260 for doped polystyrene.},

In this study, radiofrequency-LODESR was used for oximetry by measuring the relaxation times of the electron. T-1e, and T-2e were measured by investigating LODESR signal magnitude as a function of detection frequency. We have also predicted theoretically and verified experimentally the LODESR signal phase dependence on detection frequency and relaxation times. These methods are valid even for inhomogeneous lines provided that T-1e much greater than T-2e. We have also developed a new method for measuring T-1e valid for inhomogeneous spectra, for all values of T-1e and T-2e, based on measuring the spectral area as a function of detection frequency. We have measured T-1e and T-2e for lithium phthalocyanine crystals, for the nitroxide TEMPOL, and for the single line agent Triarylmethyl (TAM). Furthermore, we have collected spectra from aqueous solutions of TEMPOL and TAM at different oxygen concentrations and confirmed that T-1e values are reduced with increased oxygen concentration. We have also measured the spin-lattice electronic relaxation time for degassed aqueous solutions of the same agents at different agent concentrations. T-1e decreases as a function of concentration for TAM while it remains independent of free radical concentration for TEMPOL, a major advantage for oxygen mapping. This method, combined with the ability of LODESR to provide images of exogenous free radicals in vivo, presents an attractive alternative to the conventional transverse ESR linewidth based oximetry methods.

To gain insight into intermediate motions when the motor protein takes its 8.2-nm steps, the velocity and randomness data have been analyzed by using discrete-state stochastic models with a three-dimensional "energy landscape." The bead size and tether angle play a crucial role. The analysis implies that on binding ATP the motor "crouches," the point of attachment of the tether at the necklinker junction moving downward toward the microtubule by 0.5-0.7 nm, while inching forward by only 0.1-0.2 nm, before completing the step from a transition state by a unitary "sprint" of approximately 7.8 nm. These inferences accord with high-resolution observations that exclude a previously predicted substep of 1.8-2.1 nm. Assisting and leftward loads are opposed in that the perpendicular component of the tension in the tether is enhanced by approximately 2 pN, which reduces the velocity, but sideways lurching is not supported.},

Near the membrane surface, electrostatic interactions with the lipid head groups strongly slow down water dynamics, whereas protein-induced water retardation is weaker and dominates only at distances beyond 10 {\AA} from the membrane surface. The results can be understood from a simple model based on additive contributions from the membrane and the protein to the activation free energy barriers of water diffusion next to the biomolecular surfaces. Furthermore, analysis of the intermolecular vibrations of the water network reveals that retarded water motions near the membrane shift the vibrational modes to higher frequencies, which we used to identify an entropy gradient from the membrane surface tow...},

abstract = {This chapter elaborates protein structure prediction using Rosetta. Double-blind assessments of protein structure prediction methods have indicated that the Rosetta algorithm is perhaps the most successful current method for de novo protein structure prediction. In the Rosetta method, short fragments of known proteins are assembled by a Monte Carlo strategy to yield native-like protein conformations. Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}6 A$\backslash$r{\{}{\}} C{\$}\alpha{\$} root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of decoy structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima. The effectiveness of conformation modification operators for energy function optimization is also described in this chapter.},

The new sequence allows the no. of EPR irradn. periods to be optimized to obtain an acceptable SNR and spatial resoln. of free radical distribution in the final image while reducing the RF power deposition and increasing the temporal resoln. Centric reordered phase encoding has been employed to counter the problem of rapid decay of the Overhauser-enhanced signal. A phase-correction scheme has also been used to correct problems arising from instability of the magnetic field following field-cycling. In vivo expts. were carried out using triaryl Me free radical contrast agent, injected at a dose of 0.214 mmol kg-1 body wt. in anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Transaxial images through the abdomen were collected using 1, 2, 4 and 8 EPR irradn. periods. Using 4 EPR irradn. periods it was possible to generate free radical distributions of acceptable SNR and resoln. The EPR power deposition is reduced by a factor of 16 and the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of 4 compared to an acquisition using the conventional FC-PEDRI pulse sequence.

  abstract = {H+-form Nafion 212 films were chemically degraded via Fenton's reagent and characteristic polymer chain motions were analyzed using broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The $\beta$-relaxation peak maximum frequency (fmax) shifts to higher temperatures upon degradation, reflecting slower chain motions. Perhaps this is due to an upward shift in average molecular weight caused by low molecular weight fragments being leached out of the membrane during the degradation experiment. Permittivity data for degraded and undegraded materials were fitted to the Havriliak–Negami equation. The quantities extracted from these fits were the relaxation time ($\tau$) and parameters that reflect the breadth and asymmetry of the distribution of $\tau$. These parameters were also used in the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann–Hesse (VFTH) equation which was well-fitted to relaxation time versus temperature data. The increase in the Vogel temperature with degradation reflects more restricted chains. The distribution of relaxation time curve shifts to longer times, broadens, and is transformed from being bi- to tri-modal which reflects an increase in microstructural heterogeneity after degradation. It is concluded that dielectric spectroscopy can be a powerful tool in assessing the chemical degradation of Nafion membranes in the fuel cell environment.},

Depending on the total concn. and the pH, different types of oleic acid/oleate aggregates formed. At the 2 ends of the pH range studied (above pH 10.4 and below pH 6.4), the ESR spectra of 16-DS were highly sym., enabling calcn. of the microviscosities in the surfactant aggregates to be 4 cP and 6 cP, resp. In the high pH range, the obsd. aggregates are micelles. However, in the low pH range the microviscosity was considerably lower than that of neat oleic acid (measured to be 11 cP), indicating that the obtained emulsion system was not composed of pure oleic acid droplets. The authors postulate that the surfactant mols. at low pH form condensed aggregates of lamellar bilayers. Asym. high-field ESR lines were obtained at intermediate pH between pH 6.4 and pH 10.4. This indicates that the probe mols. were present in 2 phys. different aggregation states. The authors assigned the 2 aggregation states to be vesicles and nonlamellar aggregates (most likely nonspherical micelles), based on the observation made by microscopy and light scattering techniques. The anal. of the ESR lines by spectral simulation using a modified Bloch equation supports the coexistence of vesicles and nonlamellar aggregates through the entire intermediate pH range; the relative amt. of the 2 aggregation forms depends critically on pH, temp., and concn. The spectral simulation indicated that particularly stable oleic acid/oleate vesicles are formed around pH 8.5, where the protonated and ionized species exist in a stoichiometric ratio.

abstract = {A high-frequency dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)/electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer operating at 211 MHz for1H and 140 GHz forg= 2 paramagnetic centers (5 T static field) is described. The salient feature of the instrument is a cyclotron-resonance maser (gyrotron) which generates high-frequency, high-power microwave radiation. This gyrotron, which under conventional operation produces millisecond pulses at kilowatt powers, has been adapted to operate at {\~{}}100 W for 1 to 20 s pulses and in the continuous wave mode at the 10 W power level. Experiments combining DNP with magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance were performed on samples consisting of 2{\%} by weight of the free radical BDPA doped into polystyrene. Room-temperature DNP enhancement factors of 10 for1H and 40 for13C were obtained in the NMR-MAS spectra. Static DNP NMR has also been performed on samples containing nitroxides dissolved in water:glycerol solvent mixtures. Enhancements of approximately 200 have been obtained for low-temperature (14 K)1H NMR. A pulsed/CW EPR spectrometer operating at 140 GHz has been developed in conjunction with the DNP spectrometer. Microwave sources include Gunn-diode oscillators which provide low-power (20 mW) radiation, and the gyrotron, which has been used to deliver higher power levels in pulsed experiments. Results using this spectrometer are presented for continuous-wave and echo-detected EPR, electron spin-echo-envelope modulation (ESEEM), and Fourier-transform EPR.},

abstract = {The local parameters (hydration, order, viscosity) in different aggregates (micelle, hexagonal and lamellar liq. crystals) in the phase diagram of poly(oxyethylene)[5]-dodecyl ether (C12E5) in water have been measured by EPR with two series of spin probes: x-DSA (x-doxyl stearic acid, x = 5, 7, 10, 12 and 16) and CAT n [4-(N,N'-dimethyl-N-alkyl)ammonium-2,2',6,6'-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy iodide, n = 4, 8, 11 and 16]. A rather complete map of hydration ([H2O]/[EO]) along the PEO chains has been detd. The hydration of the PEO regions is very low near the PEO/hydrocarbon interface in all phases and increases towards the outer region of the PEO shell with a gradient which becomes steeper in micellar phase in comparison with the lamellar phase. Temp. increase reduces the hydration levels at all measured sites. The order of the chains decreases by diln. from the lamellar to the micellar phase, but it is preserved within the frame of the lamellar phase at two different concns. The order degree, S, decreases in the series 5- {\textgreater} 7- {\textgreater} 10- {\textgreater} 12- {\textgreater} 16-doxyl, irresp. of temp., in all types of aggregates. This trend, together with decreasing hydration values, points to the insertion of the stearic acid chain in the aggregates along the normal to the interface. In samples quenched in liq. nitrogen, however, bending of the stearic acid chain was obsd. in a no. of cases. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {We previously described the generation of a set of mutations into a cDNA of poliovirus type 1 in the myristoylation signal of the capsid polypeptide VP4 (D. Marc, G. Drugeon, A.-L. Haenni, M. Girard, and S. van der Werf, EMBO J. 8:2661, 1989). Genomic transcripts synthesized in vitro from the mutated cDNAs were found to be noninfectious upon transfection of permissive cells, and this property correlated with the lack of VP0 myristoylation in vivo. In the study presented here, we analyzed the assembly intermediates that could be recovered from cells transfected with the mutated transcripts. We found that 14S pentamers could still assemble to a certain extent with an unmyristoylated VP0. Furthermore, viral particles sedimenting at 150S and containing capsid polypeptides VP1 to VP4 and virus-specific RNA were detected in the transfected cells. However, these mature virions were less abundant than those recovered after transfection with an infectious transcript, and they were devoid of infectivity. The results suggest that VP0 myristoylation plays a role in the late steps of poliovirus assembly and that the myristate moiety of VP4 may be required in the early steps of poliovirus infection.

abstract = {We present experiments in a fuel cell (FC) inserted in the resonator of the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer, which allowed separate monitoring of radical formation at anode and cathode sides. The in situ FC was operated at 300 K under closed- and open-circuit voltage conditions, CCV and OCV, respectively, with a membrane?electrode assembly (MEA) based on sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK). The formation of radicals was monitored by spin trapping ESR, with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trap. The magnetic parameters and the relative intensities of DMPO adducts were determined by simulation of the ESR spectra. The major adducts detected at both electrodes were DMPO/OOH and DMPO/H. The generation of the DMPO/OOH adduct at the anode can be explained by reaction of crossover oxygen with hydrogen atoms formed at the Pt catalyst; at the cathode this adduct can be generated by H2 crossover to the cathode, reaction at the Pt catalyst, and reaction with O2. The generation of the DMPO/OOH adduct depends therefore on gas crossover: at the anode from crossover O2 and at the cathode from crossover H2. Results indicated that the crossover rates are enhanced in the more highly hydrated membrane. No membrane-derived carbon-centered or oxygen-centered radical adducts were detected in the in situ FC. However, in SPEEK membranes directly exposed to hydroxyl radicals in the presence of DMPO, the DMPO/Ph and DMPO/OPh adducts were detected, indicating poor chemical stability of SPEEK in the ex situ Fenton test. The conclusion is that hydrocarbon membranes such as SPEEK demonstrate different chemical stabilities in the two tests.

  abstract  = {The time required to fold proteins usually increases significantly under conditions of high pressure. Taking advantage of this general property of proteins, we combined P-jump experiments with NMR spectroscopy to examine in detail the folding reaction of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) and of some of its cavity-containing variants. The nearly 100 observables that could be measured simultaneously collectively describe the kinetics of folding as a function of pressure and denaturant concentration with exquisite site-specific resolution. SNase variants with cavities in the central core of the protein exhibit a highly heterogeneous transition-state ensemble (TSE) with a smaller solvent-excluded void volume than the TSE of the parent SNase. This heterogeneous TSE experiences Hammond behavior, becoming more native-like (higher molar volume) with increasing denaturant concentration. In contrast, the TSE of the L125A variant, which has a cavity at the secondary core, is only slightly different from that of the parent SNase. Because pressure acts mainly to eliminate solvent-excluded voids, which are heterogeneously distributed throughout structures, it perturbs the protein more selectively than chemical denaturants, thereby facilitating the characterization of intermediates and the consequences of packing on folding mechanisms. Besides demonstrating how internal cavities can affect the routes and rates of folding of a protein, this study illustrates how the combination of P-jump and NMR spectroscopy can yield detailed mechanistic insight into protein folding reactions with exquisite site-specific temporal information.},

  abstract      = {CW-EPR studies of NO adsorbed on sodium ion-exchanged zeolites were focused on the geometrical structure of NO monoradical and (NO)2 biradical formed on zeolites. The EPR spectrum of NO monoradical adsorbed on zeolite can be characterized by the three different g-tensor components and the resolved y-component hyperfine coupling with the 14N nucleus. Among the g-tensor components, the value of gzz is very sensitive to the local environment of zeolite and becomes a measure of the electrostatic field in zeolite. The temperature dependence of the g-tensor demonstrated the presence of two states of the Na-NO adduct, in rigid and rotational states. The EPR spectra of NO adsorbed on alkaline metal ion-exchanged zeolite and their temperature dependency are essentially the same as that on sodium ion-exchanged zeolite. On the other hand, for NO adsorbed on copper ion-exchanged zeolite it is known that the magnetic interaction between NO molecule and paramagnetic copper ion are observable in the spectra recorded at low temperature. The signals assigned to (NO)2 biradical were detected for EPR spectrum of NO adsorbed on Na-LTA. CW-EPR spectra as well as their theoretical calculation suggested that the two NO molecules are aligned along their N---O bond axes. A new procedure for automatical EPR simulation is described which makes it possible to analyze EPR spectrum easily. In the last part of this paper, some instances when other nitrogen oxides were used as a probe molecule to characterize the zeolite structure, chemical properties of zeolites, and dynamics of small molecules were described on the basis of selected literature data reported recently.},

The necessary resonator employed in pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) rings after the excitation pulse and creates a finite detector dead-time that ultimately prevents the detection of signal from fast relaxing spin systems, hindering the application of pulse EPR to room temperature measurements of interesting chemical or biological systems. We employ a recently available high bandwidth arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) to produce a cancellation pulse that precisely destructively interferes with the resonant cavity ring-down. We find that we can faithfully detect EPR signal at all times immediately after, as well as during, the excitation pulse. This is a proof of concept study showcasing the capability of AWG pulses to precisely cancel out the resonator ring-down, and allow for the detection of EPR signal during the pulse itself, as well as the dead-time of the resonator. However, the applicability of this approach to conventional EPR experiments is not immediate, as it hinges on either (1) the availability of low-noise microwave sources and amplifiers to produce the necessary power for pulse EPR experiment or (2) the availability of very high conversion factor micro coil resonators that allow for pulse EPR experiments at modest microwave power.},

By following the same single molecules at various temperatures, we find that the distribution of local viscosities itself broadens upon approaching T(g). This spatial heterogeneity is found to relax extremely slowly, persisting over hours or even days.

Advantages of this method, termed "inverse transition cycling," include technical simplicity, low cost, ease of scale-up, and capacity for multiplexing.

  abstract = {Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is genetically linked to dementia and linked to Alzheimer's disease via its presence in intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangle deposits, where it takes the form of aggregated paired helical and straight filaments. Although the precise mechanisms by which tau contributes to neurodegeneration remain unclear, tau aggregation is commonly considered to be a critical component of tau-mediated pathogenicity. Nevertheless, the context in which tau aggregation begins in vivo is unknown. Tau is enriched in membrane-rich neuronal structures such as axons and growth cones, and can interact with membranes both via intermediary proteins and directly via its microtubule-binding domain (MBD). Membranes efficiently facilitate tau aggregation in vitro, and may therefore provide a physiologically relevant context for nucleating tau aggregation in vivo. Furthermore, tau-membrane interactions may potentially play a role in tau's poorly understood normal physiological functions. Despite the potential importance of direct tau-membrane interactions for tau pathology and physiology, the structural mechanisms that underlie such interactions remain to be elucidated. Here, we employ electron spin resonance spectroscopy to investigate the secondary and long-range structural properties of the MBD of three-repeat tau isoforms when bound to lipid vesicles and membrane mimetics. We show that the membrane interactions of the tau MBD are mediated by short amphipathic helices formed within each of the MBD repeats in the membrane-bound state. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed elucidation of helical tau structure in the context of intact lipid bilayers. We further show, for the first time (to our knowledge), that these individual helical regions behave as independent membrane-binding sites linked by flexible connecting regions. These results represent the first (to our knowledge) detailed structural view of membrane-bound tau and provide insights into potential mechanisms for membrane-mediated tau aggregation. Furthermore, the results may have implications for the structural basis of tau-microtubule interactions and microtubule-mediated tau aggregation.},

Here I review several interrelated areas of recent work on aqueous systems that aim to explore and explain this richness by revealing molecular arrangements, their thermodynamic origins, and the timescales on which they change. Vibrational spectroscopy of OH stretching features prominently in these discussions, with an emphasis on efforts to establish connections between spectroscopic signals and statistics of intermolecular structure. For bulk solutions, the results of these efforts largely verify and enrich existing physical pictures of hydrogen-bond network connectivity, dynamics, and response. For water at interfaces, such pictures are still emerging. As an important example I discuss the solvation of small ions at the air-water interface, whose surface propensities challenge a basic understanding of how aqueous fluctuations accommodate solutes in heterogeneous environments.},

Analyzing simulation trajectories gives direct evidence that water-mediated interactions facilitate native-like packing of supersecondary structural elements.

Specific water-mediated interactions are a universal feature of biomolecular recognition landscapes in both folding and binding.},

From chronoamperometric experiments with a point contact electrode spatially resolved electrochemical impedance spectra are obtained from which information about electrode processes and proton transport in the membrane is derived. In the first part the oxygen reduction reaction is investigated. Due to the absence of diffusion limitation, which is partly a result of the small electrode size, a low frequency inductive loop is observed, which is normally masked in macroscopic electrochemical impedance spectra. The influence of water formation from the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode is discussed. The second part focuses on a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell setup. A qualitative explanation is given for the necessity of an applied voltage in addition to the electrochemical potential. Electrochemical impedance spectra obtained at two different positions are compared and fitted based on a Randles-like equivalent circuit. A strongly inhomogeneous performance is observed which is attributed to the properties of the Nafion membrane. The electrolyte resistance and the Nernst impedance are restrictive parameters which describe the diffusion through the membrane.},

The classic CW-EPR technique in this case provides signals based on the g tensor only. Nevertheless a systematic analysis of the signals obtained in the various cases (anatase and rutile, surface and bulk centers, regular and defective sites) has been performed providing useful guidelines on a field affected by some confusion. The problem of the localization of the electron spin density has been tackled by means of Pulse-EPR hyperfine techniques on samples appositely enriched with (17)O. This approach has led to evidence of a substantial difference, in terms of wavefunction localization between anatase (electrons trapped in regular lattice sites exhibiting delocalized electron density) and rutile (interstitial sites showing localized electron density).},

It is a necessary ingredient in most emerging quantum technologies, including quantum repeaters, quantum information processing and the strongest forms of quantum cryptography. Spin ensembles, such as those used in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, have been important for the development of quantum control methods. However, these demonstrations contain no entanglement and ultimately constitute classical simulations of quantum algorithms. Here we report the on-demand generation of entanglement between an ensemble of electron and nuclear spins in isotopically engineered, phosphorus-doped silicon. We combined high-field (3.4 T), low-temperature (2.9 K) electron spin resonance with hyperpolarization of the (31)P nuclear spin to obtain an initial state of sufficient purity to create a non-classical, inseparable state. The state was verified using density matrix tomography based on geometric phase gates, and had a fidelity of 98{\%} relative to the ideal state at this field and temperature. The entanglement operation was performed simultaneously, with high fidelity, on 10(10) spin pairs; this fulfils one of the essential requirements for a silicon-based quantum information processor.},

N-Acetyl peptides homologous to these sequences were used to study aggregation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed seven peptides, in addition to well-known primary nucleating sequences Ac(275)VQIINK (AcPHF6*) and Ac(306)VQIVYK (AcPHF6), formed fibers, tubes, ribbons, or rolled sheets. Of the peptides shown by TEM to form amyloid, Ac(10)VME, AcPHF6*, Ac(375)KLTFR, and Ac(393)VYK were found to enhance the fraction of $\beta$-structure of AcPHF6 formed at equilibrium, and Ac(375)KLTFR was found to inhibit AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* aggregation kinetics in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with its participation in a hybrid steric zipper model. Single site mutants were generated which transformed predicted amyloidogenic sequences in tau into non-amyloidogenic ones. A M11K mutant had fewer filaments and showed a decrease in aggregation kinetics and an increased lag time compared to wild-type tau, while a F378K mutant showed significantly more filaments. Our results infer that sequences throughout tau, in addition to PHF6 and PHF6*, can seed amyloid formation or affect aggregation kinetics or thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {We propose a new approach to stabilizing the inverse Laplace transform of a multiexponential decay signal, a classically ill-posed problem, in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry. The method is based on extension to a second, indirectly detected, dimension, that is, use of the established framework of two-dimensional relaxometry, followed by projection onto the desired axis. Numerical results for signals comprised of discrete T1 and T2 relaxation components and experiments performed on agarose gel phantoms are presented. We find markedly improved accuracy, and stability with respect to noise, as well as insensitivity to regularization in quantifying underlying relaxation components through use of the two-dimensional as compared to the one-dimensional inverse Laplace transform. This improvement is demonstrated separately for two different inversion algorithms, non-negative least squares and non-linear least squares, to indicate the generalizability of this approach. These results may have wide applicability in approaches to the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a promising noninvasive technology to dynamically image tissue oxygenation. Owing to its extremely short spin-spin relaxation times, electron paramagnetic resonance imaging benefits from a single-point imaging scheme where the entire free induction decay signal is captured using pure phase encoding. However, direct T2 (*)/pO2 quantification is inhibited owing to constant magnitude gradients which result in time-decreasing field of view. Therefore, conventional acquisition techniques require repeated imaging experiments with differing gradient amplitudes (typically 3), which results in long acquisition time. METHODS: In this study, gridding was evaluated as a method to reconstruct images with equal field of view to enable direct T2 (*)/pO2 quantification within a single imaging experiment. Additionally, an enhanced reconstruction technique that shares high spatial k-space regions throughout different phase-encoding time delays was investigated (k-space extrapolation). RESULTS: The combined application of gridding and k-space extrapolation enables pixelwise quantification of T2 (*) from a single acquisition with improved image quality across a wide range of phase-encoding time delays. The calculated T2 (*)/pO2 does not vary across this time range. CONCLUSIONS: By utilizing gridding and k-space extrapolation, accurate T2 (*)/pO2 quantification can be achieved within a single data set to allow enhanced temporal resolution (by a factor of 3).},

It is versatile, as a wide range of NMR modalities can be accessed, and 2D and 3D imaging can be undertaken. Despite widespread use and major advances in clinical MRI, it has seen limited application in the pharmaceutical sciences. In vitro studies have focussed on drug release mechanisms in polymeric delivery systems, but isolated studies of bioadhesion, tablet properties, and extrusion and mixing processes illustrate the wider potential. Perhaps the greatest potential however, lies in investigations of pharmaceuticals in vivo, where pilot human and animal studies have demonstrated we can obtain unique insights into the behaviour of gastrointestinal, topical, colloidal, and targeted drug delivery systems.},

Both methods indicate that the hydration water molecules exchange with bulk water on the sub-nanosecond time scale at 4 degreesC. No evidence was obtained for water molecules bound with longer residence times. In particular, the water molecules at the sites of interfacial hydration in the trp repressor/operator complex do not seem kinetically stabilized in the uncomplexed DNA. Analysis of the crystal structures of two different trp repressor/operator complexes shows very similar structural environments for the water molecules mediating specific contacts between the protein and the DNA, whereas much larger variations are observed for the location of corresponding water molecules detected in the crystal structure of an uncomplexed trp operator DNA duplex. Therefore, it appears unlikely that the hydration characteristics of the uncomplexed DNA target would be a major determinant of trp repressor/operator recognition.},

The spectrometer is unique in that it is broadband and allows experiments to be performed at any operational frequency within the range from 26.5 to 40 GHz. The high-power microwave amplifier employed in this spectrometer allowed us to use resonators with low quality factor and to achieve a minimum inversion microwave pulse duration of 11 ns. As a result, this spectrometer can be used for all types of pulsed EPR experiments, including electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), and electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) with a difference between the pumping and observation frequencies of up to several hundred megahertz. The timing is controlled by an arbitrary waveform generator with 12 digital outputs and 1 ns time resolution.

  abstract = {Water plays a crucial part in virtually all protein-ligand binding processes in and out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the role of water in the binding kinetics of a ligand to a prototypical hydrophobic pocket by explicit-water molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and implicit diffusional approaches. The concave pocket in the unbound state exhibits wet/dry hydration oscillations whose magnitude and time scale are significantly amplified by the approaching ligand. In turn, the ligand's stochastic motion intimately couples to the slow hydration fluctuations, leading to a sixfold-enhanced friction in the vicinity of the pocket entrance. The increased friction considerably decelerates association in the otherwise barrierless system, indicating the importance of molecular-scale hydrodynamic effects in cavity-ligand binding arising due to capillary fluctuations. We derive and analyze the diffusivity profile and show that the mean first passage time distribution from the MD simulation can be accurately reproduced by a standard Brownian dynamics simulation if the appropriate position-dependent friction profile is included. However, long-time decays in the water-ligand (random) force autocorrelation demonstrate violation of the Markovian assumption, challenging standard diffusive approaches for rate prediction. Remarkably, the static friction profile derived from the force correlations strongly resembles the profile derived on the Markovian assumption apart from a simple shift in space, which can be rationalized by a time-space retardation in the ligand's downhill dynamics toward the pocket. The observed spatiotemporal hydrodynamic coupling may be of biological importance providing the time needed for conformational receptor-ligand adjustments, typical of the induced-fit paradigm.},

  abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study structural and dynamic properties of membrane proteins. The most widely used spin label is methanthiosulfonate (MTSL). However, the flexibility of this spin label introduces greater uncertainties in EPR measurements obtained for determining structures, side-chain dynamics, and backbone motion of membrane protein systems. Recently, a newer bifunctional spin label (BSL), 3,4-bis(methanethiosulfonylmethyl)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yloxy, has been introduced to overcome the dynamic limitations associated with the MTSL spin label and has been invaluable in determining protein backbone dynamics and inter-residue distances due to its restricted internal motion and fewer size restrictions. While BSL has been successful in providing more accurate information about the structure and dynamics of several proteins, a detailed characterization of the spin label is still lacking. In this study, we characterized BSLs by performing CW-EPR spectral line shape analysis as a function of temperature on spin-labeled sites inside and outside of the membrane for the integral membrane protein KCNE1 in POPC/POPG lipid bilayers and POPC/POPG lipodisq nanoparticles. The experimental data revealed a powder pattern spectral line shape for all of the KCNE1-BSL samples at 296 K, suggesting the motion of BSLs approaches the rigid limit regime for these series of samples. BSLs were further utilized to report for the first time the distance measurement between two BSLs attached on an integral membrane protein KCNE1 in POPC/POPG lipid bilayers at room temperature using dipolar line broadening CW-EPR spectroscopy. The CW dipolar line broadening EPR data revealed a 15 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 2 $\backslash$AA{\{}{\}}distance between doubly attached BSLs on KCNE1 (53/57$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}63/67) which is consistent with molecular dynamics modeling and the solution NMR structure of KCNE1 which yielded a distance of 17 {\AA}. This study demonstrates the utility of investigating the structural and dynamic properties of membrane proteins in physiologically relevant membrane mimetics using BSLs.},

A single-cell sapphire tube was used as a high-pressure cell, and powdered 1,3-bisdiphenylene-2-phenyl allyl (BDPA) free radicals were added and distributed at the wall of the cell. At all pressures the dominant DNP mechanism was a positive Overhauser enhancement, caused by proton-electron contact interactions at the fluid/solid radical interface. The observed enhancements varied from 12 at 60 bar to 17 at 300 bar. Besides the Overhauser enhancement, small solid state and thermal mixing enhancements also were observed, indicating that part of the ethylene was adsorbed at the radical surface for a prolonged time. The impacts of the experimental conditions on the Overhauser enhancement factors are discussed, and enhancements of at least 40-60 are estimated when the EPR saturation factor and the leakage factor become maximal. These data indicate that DNP-enhanced NMR has the potential of extending the impact of NMR in research areas involving supercritical fluids.},

  abstract  = {The dynamics and state of lipid bilayer-internal hydration water of unilamellar lipid vesicles dispersed in solutions is characterized. This study was enabled by a recently developed technique based on Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-driven amplification of (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal of hydration water. This technique can, in the full presence of bulk water, selectively quantify the translational dynamics of hydration water within ∼10 {\AA} around spin labels that are specifically introduced to the local volume of interest within the lipid bilayer. With this approach, the local apparent diffusion coefficients of internal water at different depths of the lipid bilayer were determined. The modulation of these values as a response to external stimuli, such as the addition of sodium chloride or ethanol and the lipid phase transitions, that alter the fluctuations of bilayer interfaces together with the activation energy values of water diffusivity shows that water is not individually and homogeneously solvating lipid's hydrocarbon tails in the lipid bilayer. We provide experimental evidence that instead, water and the lipid membrane comprise a heterogeneous system whose constituents include transient hydrophobic water pores or water structures traversing the lipid bilayer. We show how these transient pore structures, as key vehicles for passive water transport can better reconcile our experimental data with existing literature data on lipid bilayer hydration and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Amyloid formation and accumulation is a hallmark of protein misfolding diseases and is associated with diverse pathologies including type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro, amyloidogenesis is widely studied in conditions that do not simulate the crowded and viscous in vivo environment. A high volume fraction of most biological fluids is occupied by various macromolecules, a phenomenon known as macromolecular crowding. For some amyloid systems (e.g. $\alpha$-synuclein) and under shaking condition, the excluded volume effect of macromolecular crowding favors aggregation, whereas increased viscosity reduces the kinetics of these reactions. Amyloidogenesis can also be catalyzed by hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, represented by the air-water interface in vitro and diverse heterogeneous interfaces in vivo (e.g. membranes). In this study, we investigated the effects of two different crowding polymers (dextran and Ficoll) and two different experimental conditions (with and without shaking) on the fibrilization of amyloid-$\beta$ peptide, a major player in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrate that, during macromolecular crowding, viscosity dominates over the excluded volume effect only when the system is spatially non homogeneous (i.e. an air-water interface is present). We also show that the surfactant activity of the crowding agents can critically influence the outcome of macromolecular crowding and that the structure of the amyloid species formed may depend on the polymer used. This suggests that, in vivo, the outcome of amyloidogenesis may be affected by both macromolecular crowding and spatial heterogeneity (e.g. membrane turn-over). More generally, our work suggests that any factors causing changes in crowding may be susceptibility factors in AD.},

abstract = {The ability to design proteins with high affinity and selectivity for any given small molecule is a rigorous test of our understanding of the physiochemical principles that govern molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the computational design of protein-small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and $\beta$-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics.},

Probably the experimental factors that are most difficult to control are the uniformity of the vesicles and the constraints that determine their behavior. In most conditions where fusion is triggered, the probability of bilayer mechanical rupture and leakage is increased. Confining that rupture to the contact area remains the most elusive characteristic of cell fusion to mimic. It may depend on fusogenic proteins. Some membrane characteristics, such as lipid asymmetry, may be crucial and may be determined biochemically, but they are difficult to duplicate in model systems. The contact-induced formation of nonbilayer lipid structures triggered by phosphatidylinositol turnover may offer some guidance in how the biochemical and required physical changes may be coupled.},

These include narrow line widths, the possibility of novel imaging schemes, reduced imaging artifacts from susceptibility variations within a sample, and reduced system cost and complexity. In addn., ULF NMR/MRI with superconducting quantum interference devices is compatible with simultaneous measurements of biomagnetic signals, a capability conventional systems cannot offer. Acquisition of MRI at ULF must, however, account for concomitant gradients that would otherwise result in severe image distortions. In this paper, we introduce the general theor. framework that describes concomitant gradients, explain why such gradients are more problematic at low field, and present possible approaches to correct for these unavoidable gradients in the context of a non-slice-selective MRI protocol.

We therefore determined the nature of the lipoxygenase interaction with the polar-end of a paramagnetic lipid by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Distances between selected grid points on soybean seed lipoxygenase-1 (SBL1) and a lysolecithin spin-labeled on choline were measured by pulsed (electron) dipolar spectroscopy. The protein grid was designed by structure-based modeling so that five natural side chains were replaced with spin labels. Pairwise distances in 10 doubly spin-labeled mutants were examined by pulsed dipolar spectroscopy, and a fit to the model was optimized. Finally, experimental distances between the lysolecithin spin and each single spin site on SBL1 were also obtained. With these 15 distances, distance geometry localized the polar-end and the spin of the lysolecithin to the region between the two domains in the SBL1 structure, nearest to E236, K260, Q264, and Q544. Mutation of a nearby residue, E256A, relieved the high pH requirement for enzyme activity of SBL1 and allowed lipid binding at pH 7.2. This general approach could be used to locate other flexible molecules in macromolecular complexes.},

Correlation times down to 10(-12) s are easily accessible when studying low-T(g) systems by depolarized light scattering, employing a tandem-Fabry-Perot interferometer and a double monochromator. When combining these techniques with state-of-the-art photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), broad band susceptibility spectra become accessible which can compete with those of dielectric spectroscopy (DS). Comparing the results with those from DS, optical Kerr effect, and NMR, we describe the evolution of the susceptibilities starting from the boiling point T(b) down to T(g), i.e., from simple liquid to glassy dynamics. Special attention is given to the emergence of the excess wing contribution which is also probed by PCS and which signals a crossover of the spectral evolution. The process is attributed to a small-angle precursor process of the $\alpha$-relaxation, and the apparent probe dependent stretching of the $\alpha$-process is explained by a probe dependent contribution of the excess wing. Upon cooling, its emergence is linked to a strong decrease of the strength of the fast dynamics which is taken as reorientational analog of the anomaly of the Debye-Waller factor. Many glass formers show in addition a slow $\beta$-process which manifests itself rather universally in NMR, in DS, however, with different amplitudes, but not at all in PCS experiments. Finally, a three-parameter function is discussed interpolating $\tau$($\alpha$)(T) from T(b) to T(g) by connecting high- and low-temperature dynamics.},

  abstract = {Magic-angle-spinning solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) studies of natively diamagnetic uniformly (13)C,(15)N-enriched proteins, intentionally modified with side chains containing paramagnetic ions, are presented, with the aim of using the concomitant nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) as a source of long-range structural information. The paramagnetic ions are incorporated at selected sites in the protein as EDTA-metal complexes by introducing a solvent-exposed cysteine residue using site-directed mutagenesis, followed by modification with a thiol-specific reagent, N-[S-(2-pyridylthio)cysteaminyl]EDTA-metal. Here, this approach is demonstrated for the K28C and T53C mutants of B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G (GB1), modified with EDTA-Mn(2+) and EDTA-Cu(2+) side chains. It is shown that incorporation of paramagnetic moieties, exhibiting different relaxation times and spin quantum numbers, facilitates the convenient modulation of longitudinal (R(1)) and transverse (R(2), R(1rho)) relaxation rates of the protein (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N nuclei. Specifically, the EDTA-Mn(2+) side chain generates large distance-dependent transverse relaxation enhancements, analogous to those observed previously in the presence of nitroxide spin labels, while this phenomenon is significantly attenuated for the Cu(2+) center. Both Mn(2+) and Cu(2+) ions cause considerable longitudinal nuclear PREs. The combination of negligible transverse and substantial longitudinal relaxation enhancements obtained with the EDTA-Cu(2+) side chain is especially advantageous, because it enables structural restraints for most sites in the protein to be readily accessed via quantitative, site-resolved measurements of nuclear R(1) rate constants by multidimensional SSNMR methods. This is demonstrated here for backbone amide (15)N nuclei, using methods based on 2D (15)N-(13)C chemical shift correlation spectroscopy. The measured longitudinal PREs are found to be highly correlated with the proximity of the Cu(2+) ion to (15)N spins, with significant effects observed for nuclei up to approximately 20 A away, thereby providing important information about protein structure on length scales that are inaccessible to traditional SSNMR techniques.},

Here, we describe a general approach that enables the rapid determination of global protein fold in the solid phase via measurements of nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) in several analogues of the protein of interest containing covalently attached paramagnetic tags, without the use of conventional internuclear distance restraints.

abstract = {The active site of water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) is a Mn4CaO5 cluster that is located in a cavity between the D1 and CP43 protein subunits by which it is coordinated. The remainder of this cavity is filled with water molecules, which serve as a source of substrate and participate in poorly understood hydrogen bond networks that may modulate the function of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. These water molecules interact with the first and second sphere amino acid ligands to the Mn4CaO5 cluster and some water interacts directly with the Mn4CaO5 cluster. Here, the results of mutations to the amino acids that line the walls of several predicted cavities in the immediate vicinity of the Mn4CaO5 cluster were examined in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Of these, mutations of Val185 in the D1 subunit resulted in the most interesting functional alterations. The hydrophobic D1-Val185 occupies a location contacting water molecules that are positioned between the redox active tyrosine (YZ) and the putative proton gate residue, D1-Asp61, and at a position opposite the oxo bridge atom, O5, of the cluster. Mutations of the residue D1-Val185 were produced, with the intention that the substitute residue would extend into the water cavity that includes H2O molecules that interact with the Mn4CaO5 cluster, amino acid ligands of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, YZ and the chloride co-factor of PSII. Three of these mutants, D1-Val185Asn, D1-Val185Thr, and D1-Val185Phe, were able to accumulate significant levels of charge separating PSII and were characterized using polarographic and fluorescent techniques. Of the three substitutions, the phenylalanine substitution was the most severe with a complete inability to evolve oxygen, despite being able to accumulate PSII and to undergo stable charge separation. The threonine substitution had no apparent effect on oxygen evolution other than a 40{\%} reduction in the steady state rate of O2 production compared to the case of wild-type Synechocystis , due to a reduced ability to accumulate PSII centers. The asparagine substitution produced the most complex phenotype with respect to O2 evolution. Although still able to evolve oxygen, D1-Val185Asn does so less efficiently than wild-type PSII, with a higher miss factor than that for the wild type. Most significantly, asparagine substitution dramatically retards the rate of O2 release and results in an extension of the kinetic lag phase prior to O2 release that is highly reminiscent of the effects of mutations produced at D1-Asp61. The observed effects of the D1-Val185Phe and D1-Val185Asn mutations may be due to alterations in the environment of nearby chloride co-factor of PSII and/or alterations in the hydrogen bond network, perhaps impeding the movement of water to a binding site on the metal cluster.},

By measuring distances as long as approximately 7 nm between introduced pairs of nitroxide spin labels, we show that distances are close to the expectations for a single continuous helix in all cases studied. In particular, we find distances of 7.5 nm between sites 24 and 72; 5.5 nm between sites 24 and 61; and 2 nm between sites 35 and 50. We conclude that alphaS does not retain a "hairpin" structure with two antiparallel helices, as is known to occur with spheroidal micelles, in agreement with our earlier finding that the protein's geometry is determined by the surface topology rather than being constrained by the interhelix linker. While the possibility of local helix discontinuities in the structure of membrane-bound alphaS remains, our data are more consistent with one intact helix. Importantly, we demonstrate that bicelles produce very similar results to liposomes, while offering a major improvement in experimentally accessible distance range and resolution, and thus are an excellent lipid membrane mimetic for the purpose of pulse dipolar ESR spectroscopy.},

  abstract  = {Studies of membrane peptide interactions at the molecular level are important for understanding essential processes such as membrane disruption or fusion by membrane active peptides. In a previous study, we combined several electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques, particularly continuous wave (CW) EPR, electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to probe the conformation, insertion depth, and orientation with respect to the membrane of the membrane active peptide melittin. Here, we combined these EPR techniques with cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) to examine the effect of the peptide/phospholipid (P/PL) molar ratio, in the range of 1:400 to 1:25, on the membrane shape, lipids packing, and peptide orientation and penetration. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of DPPC/PG (7:3 dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/egg phosphatidylglycerol) were used as model membranes. Spin-labeled peptides were used to probe the peptide behavior whereas spin-labeled phspholipids were used to examine the membrane properties. The cryo-TEM results showed that melittin causes vesicle rupture and fusion into new vesicles with ill-defined structures. This new state was investigated by the EPR methods. In terms of the peptide, CW EPR showed decreased mobility, and ESEEM revealed increased insertion depth as the P/PL ratio was raised. DEER measurements did not reveal specific aggregates of melittin, thus excluding the presence of stable, well-defined pore structures. In terms of membrane properties, the CW EPR reported reduced mobility in both polar head and alkyl chain regions with increasing P/PL. ESEEM measurements showed that, as the P/PL ratio increased, a small increase in water content in the PL headgroup region took place and no change was observed in the alkyl chains part close to the hydrophilic region. In terms of lipid local density, opposite behavior was observed for the polar head and alkyl chain regions with increasing P/PL; while the DPPC density increased in the polar head region, it decreased in the alkyl chain region. These results are consistent with disruption of the lipid order and segregation of the PL constituents of the membrane as a consequence of the melittin binding. This work further demonstrates the applicability and potential of pulse EPR techniques for the study of peptide-membrane interactions.},

The effective determination of the thickness of the solvation layer however remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful magnetophotonic technique that can be used to study the thickness of the solvation layers formed on the colloidal silica surface in various polar solvents. A relationship between the hydrogen-bonding ability of the solvents and the thickness of solvation layer on colloidal silica surfaces has been identified; this observation is found to be consistent with the previously proposed hydrogen-bonding origin of the solvation force.},

  abstract  = {Gramicidin A was studied by continuous wave electron spin resonance (CW-ESR) and by double-quantum coherence electron spin resonance (DQC-ESR) in several lipid membranes (using samples that were macroscopically aligned by isopotential spin-dry ultracentrifugation) and vesicles. As a reporter group, the nitroxide spin-label was attached at the C-terminus yielding the spin-labeled product (GAsl). ESR spectra of aligned membranes containing GAsl show strong orientation dependence. In DPPC and DSPC membranes at room temperature the spectral shape is consistent with high ordering, which, in conjunction with the observed high polarity of the environment of the nitroxide, is interpreted in terms of the nitroxide moiety being close to the membrane surface. In contrast, spectra of GAsl in DMPC membranes indicate deeper embedding and tilt of the NO group. The GAsl spectrum in the DPPC membrane at 35 degrees C (the gel to Pbeta phase transition) exhibits sharp changes, and above this temperature becomes similar to that of DMPC. The dipolar spectrum from DQC-ESR clearly indicates the presence of pairs in DMPC membranes. This is not the case for DPPC, rapidly frozen from the gel phase; however, there are hints of aggregation. The interspin distance in the pairs is 30.9 A, in good agreement with estimates for the head-to-head GAsl dimer (the channel-forming conformation), which matches the hydrophobic thickness of the DMPC bilayer. Both DPPC and DSPC, apparently as a result of hydrophobic mismatch between the dimer length and bilayer thickness, do not favor the channel formation in the gel phase. In the Pbeta and Lalpha phases of DPPC (above 35 degrees C) the channel dimer forms, as evidenced by the DQC-ESR dipolar spectrum after rapid freezing. It is associated with a lateral expansion of lipid molecules and a concomitant decrease in bilayer thickness, which reduces the hydrophobic mismatch. A comparison with studies of dimer formation by other physical techniques indicates the desirability of using low concentrations of GA (approximately 0.4-1 mol {\%}) accessible to the ESR methods employed in the study, since this yields non-interacting dimer channels.},

The excitation profile of these pulses forms a pre-defined pattern in two dimensions, which are spanned by pulse offset and radio-frequency (RF) amplitude. The presented pulses were designed numerically based on principles of optimal control theory. For simple test patterns, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach by simulations and experiments. This previously unknown flexibility may trigger novel applications in NMR spectroscopy and imaging. As a first practical application, we demonstrate a direct approach for calibrating RF pulses.},

The structure of a Thermotoga maritima receptor cytoplasmic domain defines CheA interaction regions and metal ion-coordinating charge centers that undergo chemical modification to tune receptor response. Dimeric CheA-CheW, defined by crystallography and pulsed ESR, positions two CheWs to form a cleft that is lined with residues important for receptor interactions and sized to clamp one receptor dimer. CheW residues involved in kinase activation map to interfaces that orient the CheW clamps. CheA regulatory domains associate in crystals through conserved hydrophobic surfaces. Such CheA self-contacts align the CheW receptor clamps for binding receptor tips. Linking layers of ternary complexes with close-packed receptors generates a lattice with reasonable component ratios, cooperative interactions among receptors and accessible sites for modification enzymes.},

Here, we demonstrate by means of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations that the traditional explanation of the Hofmeister ordering of ions in terms of their bulk hydration properties is inadequate. Using triglycine as a model system, we show that the Hofmeister series for anions changes from a direct to a reversed series upon uncapping the N-terminus. Weakly hydrated anions, such as iodide and thiocyanate, interact with the peptide bond, while strongly hydrated anions like sulfate are repelled from it. In contrast, reversed order in interactions of anions is observed at the positively charged, uncapped N-terminus, and by analogy, this should also be the case at side chains of positively charged amino acids. These results demonstrate that the specific chemical and physical properties of peptides and proteins play a fundamental role in ion-specific effects. The present study thus provides a molecular rationalization of Hofmeister ordering for the anions. It also provides a route for tuning these interactions by titration or mutation of basic amino acid residues on the protein surface.},

The 3′-hydroxyl group in these nucleotides was replaced by a 3′-amino group, which was further derivatized by the introduction of a spin-label reporter group. The biological activity of 3′SL-GDP and 3′SL-GTP could be demonstrated by measuring the interaction of these spin-labelled derivatives with bacterial elongation factor Tu. The amino modification and spin labelling only slightly influenced the affinity of the guanosine nucleotides for EF-Tu from Escherichia coli or Thermus thermophilus. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements revealed a strong immonilization of the labelled nucleotides upon binding to T. thermophilus EF-Tu. Significant differences between the spectra of EF-Tu{\textperiodcentered}3′SL-GDP, EF-Tu{\textperiodcentered}3′SL-GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA {\textperiodcentered}EF-Tu{\textperiodcentered}3′SL-GTP ternary complexes were oberved.

abstract = {This report describes a computer-aided CW- and pulsed-ESR (EPR) investigation on the structural modification of dimyristoylphosphatidylcoline (DMPC) vesicles, which occur upon interaction with starburst dendrimers (SBDs). Probes used for this study included doxyl-functionalized stearic acids, with the doxyl group attached at different positions of the stearic chain (5DXSA, 12DXSA, and 16DXSA). Mainly mobility and polarity parameters were evaluated from the anal. of the CW-EPR spectra, whereas the anal. of the decay and modulation of the electron spin-echo (ESE) signal provided information on the structural environment of the paramagnetic center. Due to the interaction with the SBD surface, the vesicle structure became more rigid and ordered. The enhanced rigidity of the structure also caused the tilting of the chains of about 50 Deg with respect to the surface line. The permeability of water at the chain beginning level increased, thus increasing the rotational mobility of the probe. The perturbing effects lessened toward the end of the chains. A fraction of 16DXSA (15{\%}) was in the bent conformation, with the chain inserted into the lipid layer and the two polar heads at the external surface. The interaction with protonated dendrimers caused the swelling of the vesicle structure. This study indicated that the bilayer structure is modified but only partially perturbed by the addn. of the dendrimers, and the integrity of the vesicle, as a model cell membrane, is preserved after the interaction with the dendrimers. This is encouraging for the use of the SBDs as drug and gene carriers. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Distances also were determined by four-pulse double electron-electron resonance. For each variant, at least two methods were applicable and reasonable agreement between methods was obtained. Distances ranged from 7 to 24 A. The doubly spin-labeled samples contained some singly labeled protein due to incomplete labeling.

  abstract  = {The application of two-dimensional Fourier-transform electron-spin-resonance (2D-FT-ESR) to the study of lipid/gramicidin A (GA) interactions is reported. It is shown that 2D-FT-ESR spectra provide substantially enhanced spectral resolution to changes in the dynamics and ordering of the bulk lipids (as compared with cw-ESR spectra), that result from addition of GA to membrane vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) in excess water containing 16-PC as the lipid spin label. The agreement between the theory of Lee, Budil, and Freed and experimental results is very good in the liquid crystalline phase. Both the rotational and translational diffusion rates of the bulk lipid are substantially decreased by addition of GA, whereas the ordering is only slightly increased, for a 1:5 ratio of GA to lipid. The slowing effect on the diffusive rates of adding GA in the gel phase is less pronounced. It is suggested that the spectral fits in this phase would be improved with a more detailed dynamic model. No significant evidence is found in the 2D-FT-ESR spectra for a second immobilized component upon addition of GA, which is in contrast to cw-ESR. It is shown from simulations of the observed 2D-FT-ESR spectra that the additional component seen in cw-ESR spectra, and usually attributed to "immobilized" lipid, is inconsistent with its being characterized by increased ordering, according to a model proposed by Ge and Freed, but it would be consistent with the more conventional model of a significantly reduced diffusional rate. This is because the 2D-FT-ESR spectra exhibit a selectivity, favoring components with longer homogeneous relaxation times, T2. The homogeneous linewidths of the 2D-FT-ESR autopeaks appear to broaden as a function of mixing time. This apparent broadening is very likely due to the process of cooperative order director fluctuations (ODF) of the lipids in the vesicle. This real-time observation of ODF is distinct from, but appears in reasonable agreement with, NMR results. It is found that addition of GA to give the 1:5 ratio has only a small effect on the ODF, but there is a significant temperature dependence.},

The absolute value of the dipole potential has been very difficult to measure, although its value has been estimated to be in the range of 200-1,000 mV from ion translocation rates (determined by the planar lipid bilayer method), the surface potential of lipid monolayers (determined by the lipid monolayer method), molecular-dynamics calculations, and electron scattering using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Spectroscopy methods have also been used to monitor the dipole potential changes on the basis of the observed fluorescence changes of voltage-sensitive probes. The dipole potential accounts for the much larger permeability of a bare phospholipid membrane to anions than cations and affects the conformation and function of membrane proteins.},

We found (1): that ferricyanide does not inhibit phosphorylation or electron transport at the concentrations required for TEMPAMINE broadening, but TEMPAMINE acts as a potent uncoupler of electron transport; (2) that TEMPAMINE does not bind detectably to the thylakoid membrane or thylakoid components during the time course of a typical electron spin resonance experiment, but that some binding does occur over a 48-h period to intact thylakoids; (3) that tightly packed intact thylakoids or thylakoids which have been disrupted in a 20{\%} Triton X-100 do not hinder the motion of TEMPAMINE by more than a factor of 1.9; (4) that TEMPAMINE in the presence of 80 mm potassium ferricyanide gives rise to a signal characteristic of TEMPAMINE tumbling isotropically in an aqueous environment with a bulk viscosity of about 10 cP; and (5) that, although ferricyanide leaks slowly into the thylakoid interior, it does not alter the measurement of TEMPAMINE rotation. We conclude that the thylakoid interior is more viscous than bulk water. This may have functional significance regarding transport of electrons from Photosystem II and I to the ATP synthetase.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D-FT) and CW-ESR experiments at X-band frequencies were performed over a broad range of temperatures covering the solid and melt states of a liquid crystalline (LC) polymer. The CW-ESR experiments were analyzed by conventional motional models. The nematic phase was macroscopically aligned in the de magnetic field, whereas the solid state showed microscopic order but macroscopic disorder (MOMD). An end-label on the polymer showed smaller ordering and larger reorientational rates than that of the cholestane (CSL) spin probe dissolved in the same polymer, since the former can reorient by local internal chain modes. It was demonstrated that the 2D-FT-ESR experiments provide greatly enhanced resolution to the ordering and dynamics of the end-label, especially when performed as 2D-ELDOR (electron-electron double resonance) experiments as a function of mixing time. The conventional model of Brownian reorientation in an orienting potential was unsuccessful in interpreting these results. Instead the model of a slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS), which enables differentiation between the local internal modes experienced by the end-label and the collective reorganization of the polymer molecules around the end label, yielded much improved fits to the experiments in the nematic phase. These nonlinear least squares fits showed that the polymer ''cage'' relaxes more than 2 orders of magnitude slower than the local end-chain modes, and there is a moderate orientational potential coupling the local end-chain motion to the ''cage'' with axial and nonaxial local order parameters of about 0.14 and 0.29 at 100 degrees C. In the solid state the 2D-ELDOR spectra were fitted to the MOMD model, which is a limiting case of the SRLS model when the cage relaxation becomes very slow.},

  abstract  = {By means of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we explore geometrical, transport, and sorption properties of hydrated Nafion-type polyelectrolyte membranes. Composed of perfluorinated backbone with sulfonate sidechains, Nafion segregates into interpenetrating hydrophilic and hydrophobic subphases. This segregated morphology determines the transport properties of Nafion membranes that are widely used as compartment separators in fuel cells and other electro-chemical devices, as well as permselective diffusion barriers in protective fabrics. We introduce a coarse-grained model of Nafion, which accounts explicitly for polymer rigidity and the electrostatic interactions between anionic sidechains and hydrated metal cations. In a series of DPD simulations with increasing water content, a classical percolation transition from a system of isolated water clusters to a 3D network of hydrophilic channels was observed. The hydrophilic subphase connectivity was characterized by constructing its digitized replica and performing random walk simulations. A non-monotonic dependence of tracer diffusivity on the water content was found. This unexpected behavior was explained by formation of large and mostly isolated water domains detected at high water content and high equivalent polymer weight. Using MC simulations, we calculated the chemical potential of water in the hydrated polymer and constructed the water sorption isotherms, which extended to the oversaturated conditions. We determined that the maximum diffusivity and the onset of formation of large water domains corresponded to the saturation conditions at 100{\%} humidity. The oversaturated membrane morphologies generated in the canonical ensemble DPD simulations correspond to the membrane metastable and unstable states.},

abstract = {Frequency-swept pulses are not typically employed to excite spins in NMR. When used for selective excitation in MRI, such pulses do not produce a proper echo because the phase of the transverse magnetization varies in a quadratic manner across the slice or slab. Previously, frequency-swept pulses such as the chirp pulse have been shown to offer an approach to reduce the peak radiofrequency power required for excitation. It has also been shown that chirp excitation produces a unique type of echo (dubbed "pseudo-echo" here) and images can be generated from the resultant pseudo-echoes using a quadratic reconstruction method (J.G. Pipe, Magn Reson Med 1995;33:24-33). The present work describes a general theory and methods for exciting spins with other types of frequency-swept pulses (HSn pulses), which offer the advantage of delivering better excitation profiles than the chirp pulse. Here, pseudo-echoes are produced with HSn pulses in conventional gradient-echo 3D MRI, and high-quality images are reconstructed using standard fast Fourier transformation. An optional apodization procedure using a sliding window function is also introduced. When the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter is limiting, signal-to-noise ratio of pseudo-echo imaging is superior to that obtained with standard excitations.},

For small samples it is possible to design different resonators that have much better power handling properties and higher sensitivity. Other parameters being equal, the sensitivity of the resonator can be increased by minimising its size and thus increasing the filling factor. Like in NMR, it is possible to use lumped elements; coils can confine the microwave field to volumes that are much smaller than the wavelength. We discuss the design and evaluation of EPR resonators on the basis of planar microcoils. Our test resonators, which operate at a frequency of 14 GHz, have excellent microwave efficiency factors, achieving 24 ns pi/2 EPR pulses with an input power of 17 mW. The sensitivity tests with DPPH samples resulted in the sensitivity value 2.3 x 10(9) spins.G(-1) Hz(-1/2) at 300 K.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, unilateral NMR systems such as the NMR-MOUSE have used the fringe field between two bar magnets joined with a yoke in a 'U' geometry. This allows NMR signals to be acquired from a sensitive volume displaced from the magnets, permitting large samples to be investigated. The drawback of this approach is that the static field (B0) generated in this configuration is inhomogeneous, and has a large, nonlinear, gradient. As a consequence, the sensitive volume of the instrument is both small and ill defined. Empirical redesign of the permanent magnet array producing the B0 field has yielded instruments with magnetic field topologies acceptable for varying applications. The drawback of current approaches is the lack of formalism in the control of B0. Rather than tailoring the magnet geometry to NMR investigations, measurements must be tailored to the available magnet geometry. In this work, we present a design procedure whereby the size, shape, field strength, homogeneity, and gradients in the sensitive spot of a unilateral NMR sensor can be controlled. Our design uses high permeability pole pieces, shaped according to the contours of an analytical expression, to control B0, allowing unilateral NMR instruments to be designed to generate a controlled static field topology. We discuss the approach in the context of previously published design techniques, and explain the advantages inherent in our strategy as compared to other optimization methods. We detail the design, simulation, and construction of a unilateral magnet array using our approach. It is shown that the fabricated array exhibits a B0 topology consistent with the design. The utility of the design is demonstrated in a sample nondestructive testing application. Our design methodology is general, and defines a class of unilateral permanent magnet arrays in which the strength and shape of B0 within the sensitive volume can be controlled.},

abstract = {We describe our recent developments towards 3D micron-scale imaging capability, based on electron spin resonance (ESR), and its application to the study of controlled release. The method, termed ESR microscopy (ESRM), is an extension of the conventional "millimeter-scale" ESR imaging technique. It employs paramagnetic molecules (such as stable radicals or spin-labeled drugs) and may enable one to obtain accurate 3D spatially resolved information about the drug concentration, its self-diffusion tensor, rotational correlation time and the pH in the release matrix. Theoretical calculations, along with initial experimental results, suggest that a 3D resolution of approximately 1 microm is feasible with this method. Here we were able to image successfully a high spin concentration sample with a resolution of approximately 3 x 3 x 8 microm and subsequently study a single approximately 120 microm biodegradable microsphere, internalized with a dilute solution of trityl radical, with a resolution of approximately 12.7 x 13.2 x 26 microm. Analysis of the microsphere ESR imaging data revealed a likely increase in the viscosity inside the sphere and/or binding of the radical molecule to the sphere matrix. Future directions for progress are also discussed.},

Torsional profiles for the chain bonds have been calculated ab initio, and steric interactions with the alpha-helix and the neighboring residues have been introduced at the excluded-volume level. As a consequence of the restrictions deriving from chain geometry and local constraints, a limited number of allowed conformers has been identified that undergo torsional oscillations and conformational jumps. Torsional fluctuations are described as damped oscillations, while transition rates between conformers are calculated according to the Langer multidimensional extension of the Kramers theory. The time scale and amplitude of the different motions are compared; the major role played by rotations of the outermost bonds of the side chain emerges, along with the effects of substituents in the pyrroline ring on the conformer distribution and dynamics. The extent and symmetry of magnetic tensor averaging produced by the side chain motions are estimated, the implications for the ESR spectra of spin-labeled proteins are discussed, and suggestions for the introduction of realistic features of the spin probe dynamics into the line shape simulation are presented.},

Prior to being used as drug vehicles in the living organisms, all of the new carriers are required to be fully characterized from a physico-chemical point of view, with respect to stability, charge, size, mobility, etc. To this aim, several molecular and bulky techniques have been employed for characterization. This review considers the results obtained with a molecularly oriented spectroscopic method, i.e. electron spin resonance (ESR). The application of this technique in its various forms derived from continuous-wave (cw-ESR) and pulsed-wave (pw-ESR) modes are reviewed. In particular, carriers such as liposomes (intended for gene therapy, boron neutron capture therapy, oxymetry, and others), micelles, hydrogels, nanoparticles, dendrimers, cyclodextrins and cucurbit[n]urils are considered.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

abstract = {Many important biochemical processes occur on the time-scales of nanoseconds and microseconds. The introduction of the laser temperature-jump (T-jump) to biophysics more than a decade ago opened these previously inaccessible time regimes up to direct experimental observation. Since then, laser T-jump methodology has evolved into one of the most versatile and generally applicable methods for studying fast biomolecular kinetics. This perspective is a review of the principles and applications of the laser T-jump technique in biophysics. A brief overview of the T-jump relaxation kinetics and the historical development of laser T-jump methodology is presented. The physical principles and practical experimental considerations that are important for the design of the laser T-jump experiments are summarized. These include the Raman conversion for generating heating pulses, considerations of size, duration and uniformity of the temperature jump, as well as potential adverse effects due to photo-acoustic waves, cavitation and thermal lensing, and their elimination. The laser T-jump apparatus developed at the NIH Laboratory of Chemical Physics is described in detail along with a brief survey of other laser T-jump designs in use today. Finally, applications of the laser T-jump in biophysics are reviewed, with an emphasis on the broad range of problems where the laser T-jump methodology has provided important new results and insights into the dynamics of the biomolecular processes.},

  abstract  = {An accurate and efficient formalism is presented for simulating the effects of molecular motion on satellite and central transition nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)spectra of half-integer quadrupole nuclei. The approach is based on the principles of the density operator and the stochastic Liouville–von Neumann equation and may be applied for both rotating and nonrotating samples. The symmetry properties of nuclear spin ensembles have been used to rewrite the stochastic Liouville–von Neumann equation in the form of a linear homogeneous system of coupled first-order differential equations among the alignments and coherences. This system is highly stiff and can only be solved by methods that are sufficiently accurate and stable. The properties of Cartan–Weyl operators have been used to obtain the most efficient solution for secular interactions. The methodology has been incorporated into computer programs to simulate the effects of motion for any half-integer quadrupole nucleus. These programs include the first- and second-order quadrupole and first-order shielding interactions. The formalism has been used to calculate central transition 17 O NMRspectra of representative model systems. The calculations have revealed several interesting and important properties of central transition NMRspectra that have been discussed in terms of the functional form of the line shape. The validity of the methodology has been demonstrated experimentally by simulating variable temperature central transition 17 O NMRspectra of the silicate ( SiO 2 ) mineral cristobalite for both rotating and nonrotating samples. The simulations have allowed the structural and dynamical details of the $\alpha$–$\beta$ phase transition in cristobalite to be separated. The line shapes can only be simulated if the effects of motion are included and are consistent with a model where the oxygen atoms reorient between six different orientations. It is found that the oxygen motion is present both before and after the $\alpha$–$\beta$ phase transition and does not change significantly at the transition temperature. The observed changes in the quadrupole and shielding parameters are shown not to be the results of motional averaging but derive from an abrupt structural change associated with the first-order character of the $\alpha$–$\beta$ phase transition. The structural changes may be interpreted in terms of a model where the Si–O–Si bond angle increases slightly.},

Together with previously published data, the new sites reported complete a continuous scan through the motif. Mutants with R1 at sites 115 and 118 were selected for crystallographic analysis to identify the structural origins of the corresponding two-component EPR spectra. At 115, R1 is shown to occupy two rotamers in the room temperature crystal structure, one of which has not been previously reported. The two components in the EPR spectrum apparently arise from differential interactions of the two rotamers with the surrounding structure, the most important of which is a hydrophobic interaction of the nitroxide ring. Interestingly, the crystal structure at 100 K reveals a single rotamer, emphasizing the possibility of rotamer selection in low-temperature crystal structures. Residue 118 is at a solvent-inaccessible site in the protein core, and the structure of 118R1, the first reported for the R1 side chain at a buried site, reveals how the side chain is accommodated in an overpacked core.},

abstract = {beta-Lactoglobulin (beta-lg) forms fibrils when heated at 80 °C, pH 2, and low ionic strength ({\textless}0.015 mM). When formed at protein concentrations {\textless}3{\%}, these fibrils are made up of peptides produced from the acid hydrolysis of the beta-lg monomer. The present study investigated the effects of the polyhydroxy alcohols (polyols) glycerol and sorbitol (0-50{\%} w/v) on beta-lg self-assembly at pH 2. Glycerol and sorbitol stabilize native protein structure and modulate protein functionality by preferential exclusion. In our study, both polyols decreased the rate of beta-lg self-assembly but had no effect on the morphology of fibrils. The mechanism of these effects was studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. Sorbitol inhibited self-assembly by stabilizing beta-lg against unfolding and hydrolysis, resulting in fewer fibrillogenic species, whereas glycerol inhibited nucleation without inhibiting hydrolysis. Both polyols increased the viscosity of the solutions, but viscosity appeared to have little effect on fibril assembly, and we believe that self-assembly was not diffusion-limited under these conditions. This is in agreement with previous reports for other proteins assembling under different conditions. The phenomenon of peptide self-assembly can be decoupled from protein hydrolysis using glycerol.},

The kinetics of the lysis in 0.30 M sucrose, 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.30 at 4 degrees C were investigated. Our results show that melittin rapidly binds to the outer surface of the erythrocyte membrane, and the surface-bound monomers produce transient openings through which approximately 40 hemoglobin molecules can escape. Concomitantly, the melittin loses its ability to effect the process, presumably by translocation through the bilayer. The half-life for this process is 1.2 min. In a much slower process, dimers of this internalized melittin again produce transient membrane openings in a steady state. On a molar basis, the synthetic peptide analogue produces a fast process comparable to that caused by melittin, but is more efficient in the slow phase. Escape of hemoglobin and of carbonic anhydrase through the openings is diffusion controlled. These results suggest that the functional units necessary for the activity of melittin-like cytotoxic peptides are a 20 amino acid amphiphilic alpha-helix with a hydrophobic:hydrophilic ratio greater than 1 and a short segment with a high concentration of positive charges.},

The extent of this perturbation has been investigated by numerous methods in the past half-century, but a consensus has still not emerged regarding the spatial range of the perturbation. To a large extent, the disparate views found in the current literature can be traced to the lack of a rigorous definition of the perturbation range. Stating that a particular solvent property differs from its bulk value at a certain distance from the protein is not particularly helpful since such findings depend on the sensitivity and precision of the technique used to probe the system. What is needed is a well-defined decay length, an intrinsic property of the protein in a dilute aqueous solution, that specifies the length scale on which a given physical property approaches its bulk-water value.

SRLS accounts for dynamical coupling between the tumbling of the protein and the local motion of the probe and for general tensorial properties. It is the generalization of the traditional model-free (MF) method, which does not account for mode-coupling and treats only simple tensorial properties. SRLS is applied herein to ²H relaxation of ¹³CDH₂ groups in the complex of Ca(2+)-calmodulin with the peptide smMLCKp. Literature data comprising ²H T₁ and T₂ acquired at 14.1 and 17.6 T, and 288, 295, 308, and 320 K, are used. We find that mode-coupling is a small effect for methyl dynamics. On the other hand, general tensorial properties are important. In particular, it is important to allow for the asymmetry of the local spatial restrictions, which can be represented in SRLS by a rhombic local ordering tensor with components S(0)(2) and S(2)(2). The principal axes frame of this tensor is obviously different from the axial frames of the magnetic tensors. Here, we find that -0.2 ≤ S(0)(2) ≤ 0.5 and -0.4 ≤ S(2)(2) ≤ 0. MF features a single "generalized" order parameter, S, confined to the 0-0.316 range; the local geometry is inherently simple. The parameter S is inaccurate, having absorbed unaccounted for effects, notably S(2)(2) ≠ 0. We find that the methionine methyls (the other methyl types) reorient with rates of 8.6 × 10⁹ to 21.4 × 10⁹ (0.67 × 10⁹ to 6.5 × 10⁹) 1/s. The corresponding activation energies are 10 (10-27) kJ/mol. By contrast, MF yields inaccurate effective local motional correlation times, $\tau$(e), with nonphysical temperature dependence. Thus, the problematic S- and $\tau$(e)-based MF picture of methyl dynamics has been replaced with an insightful physical picture based on a local ordering tensor related to structural features, and a local diffusion tensor that yields accurate activation energies.},

  abstract = {Neurotransmitter release at the synapse requires membrane fusion. The SNARE complex, composed of the plasma membrane t-SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 and the vesicle v-SNARE synaptobrevin, mediates the fusion of 2 membranes. Synaptic vesicles contain unusually high cholesterol, but the exact role of cholesterol in fusion is not known. In this study, cholesterol was found to stimulate SNARE-mediated lipid mixing of proteoliposomes by a factor of 5 at a physiological concentration. Surprisingly, however, the stimulatory effect was more pronounced when cholesterol was on the v-SNARE side than when it was on the t-SNARE side. Site-directed spin labeling and both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed EPR revealed that cholesterol induces a conformational change of the v-SNARE transmembrane domain (TMD) from an open scissors-like dimer to a parallel dimer. When the TMD was forced to form a parallel dimer by the disulfide bond, the rate was stimulated 2.3-fold even without cholesterol, supporting the relevance of the open-to-closed conformational change to the fusion activity. The open scissors-like conformation may be unfavorable for fusion and cholesterol may relieve this inhibitory factor.},

Generically, we find that densities and mobilities of both water and dissolved ions are spatially heterogeneous in the plane parallel to the electrode over nanosecond timescales.

A methodology for noninvasive pO2 imaging based on the application of TD-EPR using oxygen-induced LW broadening of a triarylmethyl (TAM)-based radical is presented. The decay of pixel intensities in an image is used to estimate T2*, which is inversely proportional to pO2. Factors affecting T2* in each pixel are critically analyzed to extract the contribution of dissolved oxygen to EPR line-broadening. Suitable experimental and image-processing parameters were obtained to produce pO2 maps with minimal artifacts. Image artifacts were also minimized with the use of a novel data collection strategy using multiple gradients. Results from a phantom and in vivo imaging of tumor-bearing mice validated this novel method of noninvasive oximetry. The current imaging protocols achieve a spatial resolution of approximately 1.0 mm and a temporal resolution of approximately 9 s for 2D pO2 mapping, with a reliable oxygen resolution of approximately 1 mmHg (0.12{\%} oxygen in gas phase). This work demonstrates that in vivo oximetry can be performed with good sensitivity, accuracy, and high spatial and temporal resolution.},

Knowledge of the organization of the membrane systems in cyanobacteria is critical to understanding the metabolic processes in these organisms. We examined the wild-type strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and a series of mutants with altered light-harvesting phycobilisome antenna systems for changes in thylakoid membrane architecture under different conditions. Using small-angle neutron scattering, it was possible to resolve correlation distances of subcellular structures in live cells on the nanometer scale and capture dynamic light-induced changes to these distances. Measurements made from samples with varied scattering contrasts confirmed that these distances could be attributed to the thylakoid lamellar system. We found that the changes to the thylakoid system were reversible between light- and dark-adapted states, demonstrating a robust structural flexibility in the architecture of cyanobacterial cells. Chemical disruption of photosynthetic electron transfer diminished these changes, confirming the involvement of the photosynthetic apparatus. We have correlated these findings with electron microscopy data to understand the origin of the changes in the membranes and found that light induces an expansion in the center-to-center distances between the thylakoid membrane layers. These combined data lend a dynamic dimension to the intracellular organization in cyanobacterial cells.},

Boundary lipids were observed only in dispersions with GA/DPPC  molar ratios {\textgreater}1:15, where GA aggregates. Detailed fits by nonlinear  least squares (NLLS) methods are consistent with the boundary lipid  being characterized by a large negative order parameter ( approximately  -0.4), indicative of a dynamic bending of the end of the acyl chain,  and a substantially reduced motion, about an order of magnitude slower  than that of the bulk lipid. The NLLS analysis compares favorably with  a recent two-dimensional Fourier transform ESR study on DPPC/GA  vesicles, which accurately discerned the bulk lipid. The detailed ESR  observables are discussed in terms of the ordering effect of GA at low  concentration of GA, the dissociation of the GA channel and the dynamic  bending of the end chain segment of boundary lipid at high  concentration of GA, and of HII phase formation induced by GA. It is  suggested that these phenomena can be interpreted in terms of the  combined effects of partial dehydration of the lipid headgroup by the  GA and of the hydrophobic mismatch between GA and DPPC molecules.  Substantial hysteresis is observed for heating versus cooling cycles,  but only for a GA/DPPC molar ratio {\textgreater}1:15. This is consistent with  the aggregation of GA molecules at high concentrations.},

  abstract = {Small and large hydrophobic solutes exhibit remarkably different hydration thermodynamics. Small solutes are accommodated in water with minor perturbations to water structure, and their hydration is captured accurately by theories that describe density fluctuations in pure water. In contrast, hydration of large solutes is accompanied by dewetting of their surfaces and requires a macroscopic thermodynamic description. A unified theoretical description of these lengthscale dependencies was presented by Lum, Chandler, and Weeks [(1999) J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570-4577]. Here, we use molecular simulations to study lengthscale-dependent hydrophobic hydration under various thermodynamic conditions. We show that the hydration of small and large solutes displays disparate dependencies on thermodynamic variables, including pressure, temperature, and additive concentration. Understanding these dependencies allows manipulation of the small-to-large crossover lengthscale, which is nanoscopic under ambient conditions. Specifically, applying hydrostatic tension or adding ethanol decreases the crossover length to molecular sizes, making it accessible to atomistic simulations. With detailed temperature-dependent studies, we further demonstrate that hydration thermodynamics changes gradually from entropic to enthalpic near the crossover. The nanoscopic lengthscale of the crossover and its sensitivity to thermodynamic variables imply that quantitative modeling of biomolecular self-assembly in aqueous solutions requires elements of both molecular and macroscopic hydration physics. We also show that the small-to-large crossover is directly related to the Egelstaff-Widom lengthscale, the product of surface tension and isothermal compressibility, which is another fundamental lengthscale in liquids.},

We demonstrate the capability of this technique by quantifying the permeability of glycine across negatively charged liposomal bilayers composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG). The permeability coefficient of glycine across this DPPC/DPPG bilayer is measured to be (1.8 ± 0.1) × 10(-11)m/s, in agreement with the literature value. We further observed that the presence of 20 mol {\%} cholesterol within the DPPC/DPPG lipid membrane significantly retards the permeability of glycine by a factor of 4. These findings demonstrate that the high sensitivity and contrast of J-mediated (13)C ODNP affords the measurement of the permeation kinetics of small hydrophilic molecules across lipid bilayers, a quantity that is difficult to accurately measure with existing techniques.},

  abstract = {Distance distributions between paramagnetic centers in the range of 1.8 to 6 nm in membrane proteins and up to 10 nm in deuterated soluble proteins can be measured by the DEER technique. The number of paramagnetic centers and their relative orientation can be characterized. DEER does not require crystallization and is not limited with respect to the size of the protein or protein complex. Diamagnetic proteins are accessible by site-directed spin labeling. To characterize structure or structural changes, experimental protocols were optimized and techniques for artifact suppression were introduced. Data analysis programs were developed, and it was realized that interpretation of the distance distributions must take into account the conformational distribution of spin labels. First methods have appeared for deriving structural models from a small number of distance constraints. The present scope and limitations of the technique are illustrated.},

Poly(4-vinylbenzyloxy-TEMPO)-block-polystyrene (PTEMPO-b-PSt) formed spherical micelles in carbon tetrachloride, a nonselective solvent by the reaction with chlorine. UV and ESR analyses demonstrated that the micellization occurred through the oxidn. of the TEMPO by the chlorine to insol. oxoaminium chloride (OAC), the one-electron oxidant of TEMPO. The resulting POAC-b-PSt micelles served as a one-electron oxidizing agent for N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine to produce Wurster's blue chloride, reverting themselves to the PTEMPO-b-PSt unimers. The micelles also acted as a two-electron oxidizing agent for benzyl alc. to benzaldehyde. In this oxidn., no dissocn. of the micelles occurred because the OAC was converted to the insol. hydroxylamine-hydrochloride salt. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  abstract = {Maintaining the biological functionality of immobilized proteins is the key to the success of numerous protein-based biomedical devices. To that end, we studied the conformational change in calmodulin (CaM) immobilized on chemical patterns. 1-Cysteine-mutated calmodulin was immobilized on a mercapto-terminated surface through cysteine-Hg-mercapto coupling. Utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM), the average height of immobilized calmodulin was determined to be 1.87 ± 0.19 nm. After incubation in EGTA solution, the average height of the protein changed to 2.26 ± 0.21 nm, indicating the conformational change of CaM to Apo-CaM. Immobilized CaM also demonstrated a conformational change upon the reaction with known calmodulin antagonist chlorpromazine (CPZ). After incubation in CPZ solution, the average height of CPZ-bound CaM increased to 2.32 ± 0.20 nm, demonstrating that immobilized CaM has a similar response to that in bulk solution. These results show that the immobilization of calmodulin on a solid support does not interfere with the ability of the protein to bind calcium and calmodulin antagonists. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing AFM to probe and understand protein conformational changes.},

Crystallographic studies show an unprecedented Mn3M(µ4-O)(µ2-O) core that remains intact on changing M or the manganese oxidation state. Electrochemical studies reveal that the reduction potentials span a window of 700 mV and are dependent on the Lewis acidity of the second metal. With the pKa of the redox-inactive metal-aqua complex as a measure of Lewis acidity, these compounds demonstrate a linear dependence between reduction potential and acidity with a slope of ∼100 mV per pKa unit. The Sr(2+) and Ca(2+) compounds show similar potentials, an observation that correlates with the behaviour of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, which is active only if one of these two metals is present.},

  abstract = {Portable NMR systems generally suffer from poor field homogeneity and are therefore used more commonly for imaging and relaxation measurements rather than for spectroscopy. In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to increase the sample volume that is usable for spectroscopy. These include approaches based on manual shimming and those based on clever combinations of modulated radio frequency and gradient fields. However, this volume remains small and, therefore, of limited utility. We present improved pulses designed to correct for inhomogeneous dispersion across wide ranges of frequency offsets without eliminating chemical shift or spatial encoding. This method, based on the adiabatic double passage, combines the relatively larger corrections available from spatially matched rf gradients [C. Meriles et al., J. Magn. Reson. 164, 177 (2003)]. with the adjustable corrections available from time-modulated static field gradients [D. Topgaard et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 17576 (2004)]. We explain the origins of these corrections with a theoretical model that simplifies and expedites the design of the pulse waveforms. We also present a generalized method for evaluating and comparing pulses designed for inhomogeneity correction. Experiments validate this method and support simulations that offer new possibilities for significantly enhanced performance in portable environments.},

  abstract  = {The saturation transfer electron spin resonance (STESR) spectra of 10 different positional isomers of phosphatidylcholine spin-labeled in the sn-2 chain have been investigated in the low temperature phases of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. The results of continuous wave saturation and of saturation recovery measurements on the conventional ESR spectra were used to define the saturation properties necessary for interpreting the STESR results in terms of the chain dynamics. Spin labels with the nitroxide group located in the center of the chain tended to segregate preferentially from the DPPC host lipids in the more ordered phases, causing spin-spin interactions which produced spectral broadening and had a very pronounced effect on the saturation characteristics of the labels. This was accompanied by a large decrease in the STESR spectral intensities and diagnostic line height ratios relative to those of spin labels that exhibited a higher degree of saturation at the same microwave power. The temperature dependence of the STESR spectra of the different spin label isomers revealed a sharp increase in the rate of rotation about the long axis of the lipid chains at approximately 25 degrees C, correlating with the pretransition of gel phase DPPC bilayers, and a progressive increase in the segmental motion towards the terminal methyl end of the chains in all phases. Prolonged incubation at low temperatures led to an increase in the diagnostic STESR line height ratios in all regions of the spectrum, reflecting the decrease in chain mobility accompanying formation of the subgel phase. Continuous recording of the central diagnostic peak height of the STESR spectra while scanning the temperature revealed a discontinuity at approximately 14-17 degrees C, corresponding to the DPPC subtransition which occurred only on the initial upward temperature scan, in addition to the discontinuity at 29-31 degrees C corresponding to the pretransition which displayed hysteresis on the downward temperature scan.},

  abstract   = {Pulse electron paramagnetic resonance and hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy have been used to investigate nitrogen coordination of the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenase of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F in its oxidized "ready" state. The obtained (14)N hyperfine (A = [+1.32, +1.32, +2.07] MHz) and nuclear quadrupole (e(2)qQ/h = -1.9 MHz, eta = 0.37) coupling constants were assigned to the N(epsilon) of a highly conserved histidine (His88) by studying a hydrogenase preparation in which the histidines were (15)N labeled. The histidine is hydrogen-bonded via its N(epsilon)-H to the nickel-coordinating sulfur of a cysteine (Cys549) that carries an appreciable amount of spin density. Through the hydrogen bond a small fraction of the spin density ( approximately 1{\%}) is delocalized onto the histidine ring giving rise to an isotropic (14)N hyperfine coupling constant of about 1.6 MHz. These conclusions are supported by density functional calculations. The measured (14)N quadrupole coupling constants are related to the polarization of the N(epsilon)-H bond, and the respective hydrogen bond can be classified as being weak.},

The fluidity of the surface region of the liposomes and the proton pumping across the reconstituted proteoliposomes with tonoplast H+-ATPase decreased with increasing content of the glycolipids. The proton pumping across chimera proteoliposomes was reduced by chilling only when it was reconstituted in the presence of tonoplast glycolipids from chilled Boro cells.

  abstract = {Crystal defects in diamond have emerged as unique objects for a variety of applications, both because they are very stable and because they have interesting optical properties. Embedded in nanocrystals, they can serve, for example, as robust single-photon sources or as fluorescent biomarkers of unlimited photostability and low cytotoxicity. The most fascinating aspect, however, is the ability of some crystal defects, most prominently the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, to locally detect and measure a number of physical quantities, such as magnetic and electric fields. This metrology capacity is based on the quantum mechanical interactions of the defect's spin state. In this review, we introduce the new and rapidly evolving field of nanoscale sensing based on single NV centers in diamond. We give a concise overview of the basic properties of diamond, from synthesis to electronic and magnetic properties of embedded NV centers. We describe in detail how single NV centers can be harnessed for nanoscale sensing, including the physical quantities that may be detected, expected sensitivities, and the most common measurement protocols. We conclude by highlighting a number of the diverse and exciting applications that may be enabled by these novel sensors, ranging from measurements of ion concentrations and membrane potentials to nanoscale thermometry and single-spin nuclear magnetic resonance.},

abstract = {Experimental results of RNase-A stabilization by sugar osmolytes show that the change in the Gibbs free energy ($\Delta$GD) associated with the equilibrium, N (native) state ↔ D (denatured) state of the protein in the presence of equimolar mixture of monosaccharides is larger than that of the corresponding oligosaccharides at a given temperature and pH. However, at the molar scale, $\Delta$GD obtained in the presence of an oligosaccharide is much higher as compared with $\Delta$GD obtained using individual monosaccharide. We used scaled particle theory (SPT) to explain these experimental observations. The effective length, called Tolman's length that describes the curvature correlations to a surface area or surface tension and in turn contributes to the change in free energy, is discussed. Tolman's length is higher for corresponding monomer mixture than the oligosaccharide molecules. Based on SPT analysis, a geometrical model is proposed for clustering of monosaccharides in the mixture due to high particle density. The cluster is presumed to have weak interaction among them due to larger hydrodynamic radius than that of the bonded molecules of oligosaccharides.},

In my opinion, experimental progress is hampered by a commonly used but misleading definition of allostery as protein structural changes that are elicited by the binding of a single ligand. Allostery is more strictly defined in functional terms as a comparison of how one ligand binds in the absence, versus the presence, of a second ligand. Therefore, as each of the two binding events involves two protein complexes, a study of allostery must consider four complexes and not just two. Such a comparison can distinguish allosteric from non-allosteric protein changes, the importance of which is frequently overlooked. When a study of all four complexes is not feasible, an alternative, albeit limited, strategy can identify subsets of allosteric-specific changes.},

In the XRD experiments, the samples were loaded on a small plate sample holder that was kept horizontal while measurements were made at 30, 150, and 300 degreesC. The layer distances between aromatic sheets of asphaltenes were similar to3.6 Angstrom, and the number of aromatic sheets in a stacked cluster decreased from eight to five as the temperature increased from 30 degreesC to 300 degreesC. The different crystallite parameters varied little between the three asphaltenes, although maltenes in the vacuum residua interacted with the asphaltenes and loosened their stacking by a small amount. In SAXS experiments, scattering patterns were obtained on the dry asphaltenes at room temperature in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere and the samples were then heated from 30 degreesC to 500 degreesC. The fractal aggregates of As-MY, As-KF, and As-IL broke down at 241, 179, and 243 degreesC, respectively. From these results, and earlier small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, a hypothetical hierarchical model of asphaltene aggregation is proposed.},

They appear to bind early folding intermediates, preventing their aggregation; in the presence of MgATP and a cochaperonin, bound polypeptides are released in a stepwise manner, associated with folding to the native state. Chaperonin complexes appear in the electron microscope as cylindrical structures, usually composed of two stacked rings, each containing, by negative staining, an electron dense central "hole" approximately 6.0 nm in diameter. We sought to identify the site on the Escherichia coli chaperonin groEL, where the "molten globule"-like intermediate of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) becomes bound, by examining in the scanning transmission electron microscope complexes formed between groEL and DHFR molecules bearing covalently crosslinked 1.4-nm gold clusters. In top views of the groEL complexes, gold densities were observed in the central region; in side views, the densities were seen at the end portions of the cylinders, corresponding to positions within the individual rings. In some cases, two gold densities were observed in the same groEL complex. We conclude that folding intermediates are bound inside central cavities within individual chaperonin rings. In this potentially sequestered location, folding intermediates with a compact conformation can be bound at multiple sites by surrounding monomeric members of the ring; localization of folding within the cavity could also facilitate rebinding of structures that initially fail to incorporate properly into the folding protein.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. The development, applications, and current challenges of the pulsed ESR technique of two-dimensional Electron-Electron Double Resonance (2D ELDOR) are described. This is a three-pulse technique akin to 2D Exchange Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, but involving electron spins, usually in the form of spin-probes or spin-labels. As a result, it required the extension to much higher frequencies, i.e., microwaves, and much faster time scales, with $\pi$/2 pulses in the 2-3 ns range. It has proven very useful for studying molecular dynamics in complex fluids, and spectral results can be explained by fitting theoretical models (also described) that provide a detailed analysis of the molecular dynamics and structure. We discuss concepts that also appear in other forms of 2D spectroscopy but emphasize the unique advantages and difficulties that are intrinsic to ESR. Advantages include the ability to tune the resonance frequency, in order to probe different motional ranges, while challenges include the high ratio of the detection dead time vs. the relaxation times. We review several important 2D ELDOR studies of molecular dynamics. (1) The results from a spin probe dissolved in a liquid crystal are followed throughout the isotropic → nematic → liquid-like smectic → solid-like smectic → crystalline phases as the temperature is reduced and are interpreted in terms of the slowly relaxing local structure model. Here, the labeled molecule is undergoing overall motion in the macroscopically aligned sample, as well as responding to local site fluctuations. (2) Several examples involving model phospholipid membranes are provided, including the dynamic structural characterization of the boundary lipid that coats a transmembrane peptide dimer. Additionally, subtle differences can be elicited for the phospholipid membrane phases: liquid disordered, liquid ordered, and gel, and the subtle effects upon the membrane, of antigen cross-linking of receptors on the surface of plasma membrane, vesicles can be observed. These 2D ELDOR experiments are performed as a function of mixing time, T {\textless} inf {\textgreater} m {\textless} /inf {\textgreater} , i.e., the time between the second and third $\pi$/2 pulses, which provides a third dimension. In fact, a fourth dimension may be added by varying the ESR frequency/magnetic field combination. Therefore, (3) it is shown how continuous-wave multifrequency ESR studies enable the decomposition of complex dynamics of, e.g., proteins by virtue of their respective time scales. These studies motivate our current efforts that are directed to extend 2D ELDOR to higher frequencies, 95 GHz in particular (from 9 and 17 GHz), in order to enable multi-frequency 2D ELDOR. This required the development of quasi-optical methods for performing the mm-wave experiments, which are summarized. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 95 GHz 2D ELDOR spectroscopy through its ability to resolve the two signals from a spin probe dissolved in both the lipid phase and the coexisting aqueous phase. As current 95 GHz experiments are restricted by limited spectral coverage of the $\pi$/2 pulse, as well as the very short T {\textless} inf {\textgreater} 2 {\textless} /inf {\textgreater} relaxation times of the electron spins, we discuss how these limitations are being addressed.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transform ESR techniques, such as 2D-ELDOR, have considerably improved the resolution of ESR in studies of molecular dynamics in complex fluids such as liquid crystals and membrane vesicles and in spin labeled polymers and peptides. A well-developed theory based on the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) has been successfully employed to analyze these experiments. However, one fundamental assumption has been utilized to simplify the complex analysis, viz. the pulses have been treated as ideal non-selective ones, which therefore provide uniform irradiation of the whole spectrum. In actual experiments, the pulses are of finite width causing deviations from the theoretical predictions, a problem that is exacerbated by experiments performed at higher frequencies. In the present paper we provide a method to deal with the full SLE including the explicit role of the molecular dynamics, the spin Hamiltonian and the radiation field during the pulse. The computations are rendered more manageable by utilizing the Trotter formula, which is adapted to handle this SLE in what we call a "Split Super-Operator" method. Examples are given for different motional regimes, which show how 2D-ELDOR spectra are affected by the finite pulse widths. The theory shows good agreement with 2D-ELDOR experiments performed as a function of pulse width.},

The mechanism of action of this class of peptide is a topical area of research focused predominantly on their interaction with artificial membranes. Here we compare the interaction mechanism of a model antimicrobial peptide with single artificial membranes and live bacterial cells. The interaction kinetics was imaged using time-lapse fluorescence lifetime imaging of a fluorescently-tagged melittin derivative. Interaction with the synthetic membranes resulted in membrane pore formation. In contrast, the interaction with bacteria led to transient membrane disruption and corresponding leakage of the cytoplasm, but surprisingly with a much reduced level of pore formation. The discovery that pore formation is a less significant part of lipid-peptide interaction in live bacteria highlights the mechanistic complexity of these interactions in living cells compared to simple artificial systems.},

abstract = {Thirty consecutive single cysteine substitution mutants in the amino acids Q225-I256 of bovine rhodopsin have been prepared and modified with a sulfhydryl specific nitroxide reagent. This sequence includes the E-F interhelical loop, a transducin interaction site. The accessibilities of the attached nitroxides to collisions with hydrophilic and hydrophobic paramagnetic probes in solution were determined, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra analyzed in terms of side chain mobility, both in the dark and after photoactivation. Accessibility cata shows that the rhodopsin polypeptide chain crosses an aqueous/ hydrophobic boundary in the range V227-K231 and again in the range V250-V254. In the hydrophobic segments, both the accessibility and mobility data are consistent with helical structures. In the regions of the sequence located within the aqueous phase, periodic variation in both accessibility and mobility of the spin-labeled side chains indicates that the E-F interhelical loop is largely alpha-helical, being formed by regular extensions of the E and F helices by about 1.5 and 3 turns, respectively. Judging from nitroxide mobilities, the putative extension of helix E in the aqueous phase is more dynamic than that of helix F. Changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance characteristics of the spin-labeled rhodopsin upon photoactivation indicate that chromophore isomerization results in patterns of structural changes that can be interpreted in terms of movements of helices that extend into the aqueous loop regions.},

Here, we report that broadband rotational spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic expansion unambiguously identifies all three isomers; we determined their oxygen framework structures by means of oxygen-18-substituted water (H(2)(18)O). Relative isomer populations at different expansion conditions establish that the cage isomer is the minimum energy structure. Rotational spectra consistent with predicted heptamer and nonamer structures have also been identified.},

abstract = {Context:Animal studies revealed that medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), due to their metabolic characteristics, are not stored in skeletal muscle and may therefore not give rise to potentially hazardous lipid species impeding insulin signaling.Objective:We here hypothesized that infusion of medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCT) in healthy lean subjects does not lead to ectopic fat accumulation and hence does not result in lipid-induced insulin resistance.Design and Methods:Nine healthy lean male subjects underwent a 6-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with simultaneous infusion of 1) a 100{\%} long-chain triacylglycerols (LCT) emulsion, 2) a 50/50{\%} MCT/LCT emulsion, or 3) glycerol in a randomized crossover design. Muscle biopsies were taken before and after each clamp.Results:MCT/LCT infusion raised plasma free fatty acid levels to a similar level compared with LCT infusion alone. Despite elevated free fatty acid levels, intramyocellular triacylglycerol (IMTG) levels were not affected by the MCT/LCT emulsion, whereas LCT infusion resulted in an approximately 1.6-fold increase in IMTG. These differences in muscle fat accumulation did not result in significant differences in lipid-induced insulin resistance between LCT (-28{\%}, P = 0.003) and MCT/LCT (-20{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Total skeletal muscle ceramide content as well as lactosyl- and glucosylceramide levels were not affected by any of the interventions. In addition, the distribution pattern of all ceramide species remained unaltered.Conclusions:Although we confirm that MCFA do not lead to ceramide and IMTG accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue in humans, they do induce insulin resistance. These results indicate that, in humans, MCFA may not be beneficial in preventing peripheral insulin resistance.},

The etching is carried out under the laser irradiation through the sapphire substrate of the interface sapphire/absorbing liquid. The self-modulation of the groove depth is observed in a certain range of scanning velocities of laser beam. A qualitative model of the etching process is proposed where the maximal etching depth per pulse is limited by the thermal diffusion length of sapphire during the laser pulse. The corresponding etching rate of 0.3 $\mu$m/pulse (∼ 2 mm/s) is observed experimentally. The etched areas of sapphire show the ability to reduce Cu from the electroless plating solution. Area-selective Cu metallization of the etched grooves, via- and blind holes is reported with adherence up to 18 N/mm2.},

As compared with parent cells, exosomes displayed an enrichment in sphingomyelin, but not in cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine content was decreased, but an enrichment was noted in disatd. mol. species as in phosphatidylethanolamines. Lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid was not enriched in exosomes as compared with cells. Fluorescence anisotropy demonstrated an increase in exosome-membrane rigidity from pH 5 to 7, suggesting their membrane reorganization between the acidic multivesicular body compartment and the neutral outer cell medium.

In addn., the exosome membrane exhibited no asym. distribution of phosphatidylethanolamines.

The orientational anisotropy data for three water nanopool sizes (4.0, 2.4, and 1.7 nm) can be fitted well with biexponential decays. The biexponential decays are analyzed using a wobbling-in-a-cone model that involves fast orientational diffusion within a cone followed by slower, full orientational relaxation. The data provide the cone angles, the diffusion constants for motion within the cones, and the final diffusion constants as a function of the nanopool size. The two processes can be interpreted as a local angular fluctuation of the OD and a global hydrogen bond network rearrangement process. The trend in the relative amplitudes of the long and short exponential decays suggest an increasing rigidity as the nanopool size decreases. The trend in the long decay constants indicates a longer hydrogen bond network rearrangement time with decreasing reverse micelle size. The anisotropy measurements for the reverse micelles studied extrapolate to approximately 0.33 rather than the ideal value of 0.4, suggesting the presence of an initial inertial component in the anisotropy decay that is too fast to resolve. The very fast decay component is consistent with initial inertial orientational motion that is seen in published molecular-dynamics simulations of water in AOT reverse micelles. The angle over which the inertial orientational motion occurs is determined. The results are in semiquantitative agreement with the molecular-dynamics simulations.},

Triaryl Me (TAM) free radicals have been developed as a spin probe for PEDRI since they have very long T1e. Therefore, low RF power levels are sufficient to sat. the electron spin system with resultant high NMR enhancement facilitating application of PEDRI in living animals. In this report, PEDRI studies were performed at 0.02 T. The power-dependent image enhancement was studied using phantoms of TAM in saline, then the distribution and pharmacokinetics of TAM in living mice were measured. Following i.v. administration of 0.7 mmol/kg of TAM, enhancements of up to -34 were obsd. enabling visualization of its distribution within the body. Maximum uptake of TAM in the vascular compartment was seen 1 min postadministration with half-clearance within 5 min. Maximum uptake in the kidneys occurred at 10 min with half-clearance at 26 min and max. accumulation in the bladder after 50 min. Thus, TAM is initially compartmentalized in the vasculature and this is followed by rapid uptake and excretion by the kidneys. PEDRI enabled rapid imaging of the distribution and clearance of this paramagnetic probe and this information should facilitate the use of TAM as a label for oximetry and other applications.

  abstract = {Respiratory NADH dehydrogenase-2 (NDH-2) of Escherichia coli is a peripheral membrane-bound flavoprotein. By eliminating its C-terminal region, a water soluble truncated version was obtained in our laboratory. Overall conformation of the mutant version resembles the wild-type protein. Considering these data and the fact that the mutant was obtained as an apo-protein, the truncated version is an ideal model to study the interaction between the enzyme and its cofactor. Here, the FAD binding properties of this version were characterized using far-UV circular dichroism (CD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), limited proteolysis, and steady-state and dynamic fluorescence spectroscopy. CD spectra, thermal unfolding and DSC profiles did not reveal any major difference in secondary structure between apo- and holo-protein. In addition, digestion site accessibility and tertiary conformation were similar for both proteins, as seen by comparable chymotryptic cleavage patterns. FAD binding to the apo-protein produced a parallel increment of both FAD fluorescence quantum yield and steady-state emission anisotropy. On the other hand, addition of FAD quenched the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the truncated protein, indicating that the flavin cofactor should be closely located to the protein Trp residues. Analysis of the steady-state and dynamic fluorescence data confirms the formation of the holo-protein with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry and an association constant KA=7.0(±0.8)×10(4)M(-1). Taken together, the FAD-protein interaction is energetically favorable and the addition of FAD is not necessary to induce the enzyme folded state. For the first time, a detailed characterization of the flavin:protein interaction was performed among alternative NADH dehydrogenases.},

  abstract = {The Lanczos algorithm (LA) is a useful iterative method for the reduction of a large matrix to tridiagonal form. It is a storage efficient procedure requiring only the preceding two Lanczos vectors to compute the next. The quasi-minimal residual (QMR) method is a powerful method for the solution of linear equation systems, Ax = b. In this report we provide another application of the QMR method: we incorporate QMR into the LA to monitor the convergence of the Lanczos projections in the reduction of large sparse matrices. We demonstrate that the combined approach of the LA and QMR can be utilized efficiently for the orthogonal transformation of large, but sparse, complex, symmetric matrices, such as are encountered in the simulation of slow-motional 1D- and 2D-electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra. Especially in the 2D-ESR simulations, it is essential that we store all of the Lanczos vectors obtained in the course of the LA recursions and maintain their orthogonality. In the LA-QMR application, the QMR weight matrix mitigates the problem that the Lanczos vectors lose orthogonality after many LA projections. This enables substantially more Lanczos projections, as required to achieve convergence for the more challenging ESR simulations. It, therefore, provides better accuracy for the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the large sparse matrices originating in 2D-ESR simulations than does the previously employed method, which is a combined approach of the LA and the conjugate-gradient (CG) methods, as evidenced by the quality and convergence of the 2D-ESR simulations. Our results show that very slow-motional 2D-ESR spectra at W-band (95 GHz) can be reliably simulated using the LA-QMR method, whereas the LA-CG consistently fails. The improvements due to the LA-QMR are of critical importance in enabling the simulation of high-frequency 2D-ESR spectra, which are characterized by their very high resolution to molecular orientation.},

abstract = {Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that is exploited by malignant cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many cancer-associated kinases and transcription factors, and it is essential for oncogenic transformation. Originally viewed with skepticism, Hsp90 inhibitors are now being actively pursued by the pharmaceutical industry, with 17 agents having entered clinical trials. Investigators established Hsp90's druggability using the natural products geldanamycin and radicicol, which mimic the unusual ATP structure adopted in the chaperone's N-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket and cause potent and selective blockade of ATP binding/hydrolysis, inhibit chaperone function, deplete oncogenic clients, and show antitumor activity. Preclinical data obtained with these natural products have heightened interest in Hsp90 as a drug target, and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG, tanespimycin) has shown clinical activity (as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) in HER2+ breast cancer. Many optimized synthetic, small-molecule Hsp90 inhibitors from diverse chemotypes are now in clinical trials. Here, we review the discovery and development of Hsp90 inhibitors and assess their potential. There has been significant learning from studies of the basic biology of Hsp90, as well as translational drug development involving this chaperone, enhanced by the use of Hsp90 inhibitors as chemical probes. Success will likely lie in treating cancers that are addicted to particular driver oncogene products (e.g., HER2, ALK, EGFR, and BRAF) that are sensitive Hsp90 clients, as well as malignancies (especially multiple myeloma) in which buffering of proteotoxic stress is critical for survival. We discuss approaches for enhancing the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors and highlight new chaperone and stress-response pathway targets, including HSF1 and Hsp70.},

  abstract = {Oligomerization has important functional implications for many membrane proteins. However, obtaining structural insight into oligomeric assemblies is challenging, as they are large and resist crystallization. We focus on proteorhodopsin (PR), a protein with seven transmembrane $\alpha$-helices that was found to assemble to hexamers in densely packed lipid membrane, or detergent-solubilized environments. Yet, the structural organization and the subunit interface of these PR oligomers were unknown. We used site-directed spin-labeling together with electron spin-resonance lineshape and Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization analysis to construct a model for the specific orientation of PR subunits within the hexameric complex. We found intersubunit distances to average 16 {\AA} between neighboring 55 residues and that residues 177 are {\textgreater}20 {\AA} apart from each other. These distance constraints show that PR has a defined and radial orientation within a hexamer, with the 55-site of the A-B loop facing the hexamer core and the 177-site of the E-F loop facing the hexamer exterior. Dynamic nuclear polarization measurements of the local solvent dynamics complement the electron spin-resonance-based distance analysis, by resolving whether protein surfaces at positions 55, 58, and 177 are exposed to solvent, or covered by protein-protein or protein-detergent contacts.},

  abstract = {When introduced into water, some molecules and ions (solutes) enforce the hydrogen-bonded network of neighboring water molecules that are thus restrained from thermal motions and are less mobile than those in the bulk phase (structure-making or positive hydration effect), and other solutes cause the opposite effect (structure-breaking or negative hydration effect). Using a method of microwave dielectric spectroscopy recently developed to measure the rotational mobility (dielectric relaxation frequency) of water hydrating proteins and the volume of hydration shells, the hydration of actin filament (F-actin) has been studied. The results indicate that F-actin exhibits both the structure-making and structure-breaking effects. Thus, apart from the water molecules with lowered rotational mobility that make up a typical hydration shell, there are other water molecules around the F-actin which have a much higher mobility than that of bulk water. No such dual hydration has been observed for myoglobin studied as the representative example of globular proteins which all showed qualitatively similar dielectric spectra. The volume fraction of the mobilized (hyper-mobile) water is roughly equal to that of the restrained water, which is two-thirds of the molecular volume of G-actin in size. The dielectric spectra of aqueous solutions of urea and potassium-halide salts have also been studied. The results suggest that urea and I(-) induce the hyper-mobile states of water, which is consistent with their well-known structure-breaking effect. The molecular surface of actin is rich in negative charges, which along with its filamentous structure provides a structural basis for the induction of a hyper-mobile state of water. A possible implication of the findings of the present study is discussed in relation to the chemomechanical energy transduction through interaction with myosin in the presence of ATP.},

  abstract = {High-field/high-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) offers improved sensitivity and resolution compared to ESR at conventional fields and frequencies. However, most high-field/high-frequency ESR spectrometers suffer from limited mm-wave power, thereby requiring long mm-wave pulses. This precludes their use when relaxation times are short, e.g., in fluid samples. Low mm-wave power is also a major factor limiting the achievable spectral coverage and thereby the multiplex advantage of Fourier transform ESR (FTESR) experiments. High-power pulses are needed to perform two-dimensional (213) FTESR experiments, which can unravel the dynamics of a spin system in great detail, making it an excellent tool for studying spin and molecular dynamics. We report on the design and implementation of a high-power, high-bandwidth, pulsed ESR spectrometer operating at 95 GHz. One of the principal design goals was the ability to investigate dynamic processes in aqueous samples at physiological temperatures with the intent to study biological systems. In initial experiments on aqueous samples at room temperature, we achieved 200 MHz spectral coverage at a sensitivity of 1.1x10(10)roots spins and a dead time of less than 50 ns. 2D-electron-electron double resonance experiments on aqueous samples are discussed to demonstrate the practical application of such a spectrometer. 0 2004 American Institute Of Physics.},

The directional coupler, inserted approximately midway, is a four-port crossed waveguide beamsplitter design. Two beamsplitters, a quartz plate and ten-wire array, were tested with output coupling of 2.5{\%} (-16dB) at 250.6 GHz and 1.6{\%} (-18dB), respectively. A pair of mirrors in the DNP probe transferred the gyrotron beam from the 22-mm waveguide to an 8-mm helically corrugated waveguide for transmission through the final 0.58-m distance inside the NMR magnet to the sample. The transmission-line components were all cold tested with a 248/spl plusmn/4-GHz radiometer. A total insertion loss of 0.8 dB was achieved for HE/sub 11/-mode propagation from the gyrotron to the sample with only 1{\%} insertion loss for the 22-mm-diameter waveguide. A clean Gaussian gyrotron beam at the waveguide output and reliable forward power monitoring were achieved for many hours of continuous operation. },

abstract = {The nitroxyl radical spin probes, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), 4-oxo-TEMPO (TEMPONE) and 4-amino-TEMPO (TEMPAMINE) were examined by continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in a series of cation-exchanged X-type faujasite zeolite supercages. The spectra in Li-X, Na-X and K-X between 10 and 300 K were fitted by varying the rotational correlation constants, the homogeneous linewidth, and the principal nitrogen nuclear hyperfine coupling matrix element (Azz) for the axis near the C-N-C plane normal. The TEMPONE activation energies for rotation, 12.1-3.1 kJ mol-1, decrease monotonically with cation size, suggesting an attractive interaction with the cation that depends on cation Lewis activity. TEMPO and TEMPAMINE have activation energies for rotation, 6.7-12.8 and 2.8-10.0 kJ mol-1, respectively, that increase with cation size, suggesting non-bonded repulsion of the molecules by the cations. We propose that the attraction of the cation to TEMPONE is via its carbonyl [pi] electrons, an interaction found for the larger phenalenyl [pi] systems in previous work (D.C. Doetschman, D.W. Dwyer, J.D. Fox, C.K. Frederick, S. Scull, G.D. Thomas, S.G. Utterback, J. Wei, Chem. Phys. 185 (1994) 343). In contrast, the amino group of TEMPAMINE is sp3 hybridized and has essentially no [pi] character. It is well known from X-ray diffraction studies, in which the NO group is found to project out of the C-N-C plane, and from the magnitude of the Azz nuclear hyperfine coupling element that the NO group has relatively little [pi] character. The activation energies of the TEMPO rotation are consistently larger than those of TEMPAMINE. We propose that the volume of TEMPO is effectively larger than that of TEMPAMINE because TEMPO is undergoing rapid piperidine ring inversion which does not occur in TEMPAMINE. Preliminary pulsed EPR results for TEMPO are presented that appear to indicate a second type of molecular motion associated with the motion with the piperidine ring inversion.},

  abstract = {A theory of saturation in the electron spin resonance spectra of dilute solutions of free radicals has been developed in terms of the general Boltzmann equation for the density matrix given by Bloch and Redfield. It is shown, in contrast to the earlier theories, that, in general, a composite line arising from a set of degenerate nuclear spin states must be described by a generalized (matrix) saturated Lorentzian rather than a single line of over‐all saturated Lorentzian shape. The general properties of this solution are discussed in detail for the case when electron—nuclear dipolar interactions are the only important nuclear‐spin‐dependent relaxation mechanism. A particularly simple situation exists when similar nuclei are completely equivalent. Then each composite line consists of a superposition of saturated Lorentzians, and the linewidths and saturation parameters of each component depend only on the values of the total spin and of the z component of spin of the associated configuration of the completely equivalent nuclei. Thus it would be possible to saturate some components to a greater extent than others. These simple components may become coupled together in a complex fashion when the time‐dependent fluctuations of the dipolar interactions for equivalent nuclei are no longer identical, which is often the case for aromatic‐ring protons. Further coupling may be expected from the effects of nuclear‐quadrupole interactions and from intermolecular‐exchange phenomena and are only qualitatively discussed. In the absence of saturation the present theory reduces to the linewidththeory of Freed and Fraenkel. Detailed expressions are obtained for steady‐state electron—nuclear double‐resonance (ENDOR) effects on radicals containing completely equivalent sets of nuclei. The saturating fields can lead to coherence and induced‐transition effects. It is shown how the latter, under appropriate conditions, can result in enhancement of saturated ESR spectra. It appears necessary for enhancements that lattice‐induced nuclear spin transitions should be comparable in magnitude to the lattice‐induced electron spin transitions, or else cross transitions involving both nuclear and electron spins must be important in the relaxation process. Coherenceeffects involving both electron and nuclear spin transitions should be unimportant when the main contribution to the ESRlinewidths results from secular processes and is nuclear spin independent. This is also the condition for NMR linewidths to be significantly narrower than ESRlinewidths. Complications still arise from the coherence and linewidth coupling effects of the different nuclear transitions being excited. A brief discussion of enhancement by a transient ``heating'' effect is also given.},

  abstract = {Biomolecules are highly pressure-sensitive, but their dynamics upon return to ambient pressure are often too fast to observe with existing approaches. We describe a sample-efficient method capable of large and very fast pressure drops ({\textless}1 nanomole, {\textgreater}2,500 atmospheres and {\textless}0.7 microseconds). We validated the method by fluorescence-detected refolding of a genetically engineered lambda repressor mutant from its pressure-denatured state. We resolved barrierless structure formation upon return to ambient pressure; we observed a 2.1 +/- 0.7 microsecond refolding time, which is very close to the 'speed limit' for proteins and much faster than the corresponding temperature-jump refolding of the same protein. The ability to experimentally perform a large and very fast pressure drop opens up a new region of the biomolecular energy landscape for atomic-level simulation.},

  abstract = {Macrophages in advanced atherosclerotic lesions accumulate large amounts of unesterified, or "free," cholesterol (FC). FC accumulation induces macrophage apoptosis, which likely contributes to plaque destabilization. Apoptosis is triggered by the enrichment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with FC, resulting in depletion of ER calcium stores, and induction of the unfolded protein response. To explain the mechanism of ER calcium depletion, we hypothesized that FC enrichment of the normally cholesterol-poor ER membrane inhibits the macrophage ER calcium pump, sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-2b (SERCA2b). FC enrichment of ER membranes to a level similar to that occurring in vivo inhibited both the ATPase activity and calcium sequestration function of SERCA2b. Enrichment of ER with ent-cholesterol or 14:0-18:0 phosphatidylcholine, which possess the membrane-ordering properties of cholesterol, also inhibited SERCA2b. Moreover, at various levels of FC enrichment of ER membranes, there was a very close correlation between increasing membrane lipid order, as monitored by 16-doxyl-phosphatidycholine electron spin resonance, and SERCA2b inhibition. In view of these data, we speculate that SERCA2b, a conformationally active protein with 11 membrane-spanning regions, loses function due to decreased conformational freedom in FC-ordered membranes. This biophysical model may underlie the critical connection between excess cholesterol, unfolded protein response induction, macrophage death, and plaque destabilization in advanced atherosclerosis.},

The sequence-specific secondary structure was assigned primarily from nitroxide scanning experiments in which the solvent accessibility and mobility of a nitroxide probe were measured as a function of residue number. Seven beta-strands were identified and their orientation relative to the aqueous solvent determined, thus defining the residues lining the hydrophobic core. The pairwise packing of adjacent strands in the primary structure was deduced from patterns of proximities in nitroxide pairs with one member on the exposed surface of each strand. In addition to identifying supersecondary structures, these proximities revealed that the seven strands are arranged in two beta-sheets. The overall packing of the two sheets was determined by application of the general rules of protein structure and from proximities in nitroxide pairs designed to distinguish between known all beta-sheet folds. Our data are consistent with an immunoglobulin-like fold consisting of two aligned beta-sheets. Comparison of this folding pattern to that of the evolutionary distant alpha-crystallin domain in Methanococcus jannaschii heat-shock protein 16.5 reveals a conserved core structure with the differences sequestered at one edge of the beta-sandwich. A beta-strand deletion in alphaA-crystallin disrupts a subunit interface and allows for a different dimerization motif. Putative substrate binding regions appear to include a buried loop and a buried turn, suggesting that the chaperone function involves a disassembly of the oligomer.},

Membranes were derived from the total lipids extracted from 2-year-old porcine lens cortex and nucleus. Two findings are especially significant. First, measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation times T1 for n-PCs allowed T1 profiles across the membrane to be obtained. These profiles reflect local membrane properties differently than profiles of the order parameter. Profiles obtained at W-band are, however, shifted to longer T1 values compared to those obtained at X-band. Second, using cholesterol analog spin labels and relaxation agents (hydrophobic oxygen and water-soluble NiEDDA), the cholesterol bilayer domain was discriminated in membranes made from lipids of the lens nucleus. However, membranes made from cortical lipids show a single homogeneous environment. Profiles of the oxygen transport parameter obtained from W-band measurements are practically identical to those obtained from X-band measurements, and are very similar to those obtained earlier at X-band for membranes made of 2-year-old bovine cortical and nuclear lens lipids (M. Raguz, J. Widomska, J. Dillon, E.R. Gaillard, W.K. Subczynski, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1788 (2009) 2380-2388). Results demonstrate that SR EPR at W-band has the potential to be a powerful tool for studying samples of small volume, ∼30 nL, compared with the sample volume of ∼3 muL at X-band.},

We prepared micelle suspensions of the pair of 30-residue chains that span the membrane in the native structure, with varying levels of heavy ((13)C=(18)O) isotopes substituted in the backbone of the central 10th through 20th positions. The constraints derived from vibrational coupling of the precisely spaced heavy residues led to determination of an optimized structure from a range of model candidates: Glycine residues at the 12th, 15th, and 16th positions form a tertiary contact in parallel right-handed helix dimers with crossing angles of -58° ± 9° and interhelical distances of 7.7 ± 0.5 angstroms. The frequency correlation established the dynamical model used in the analysis, and it indicated the absence of mobile water associated with labeled residues. Delocalization of vibrational excitations between the helices was also quantitatively established.},

At low ionic strength, the decrease of the negative charge density can be ascribed to a different exposure of the phosphate to water, as there is a good correlation to an increase in the area per lipid. At high ionic strength, the magnitude of the changes in the zeta potential produced by the effects on the dipole potential was found to be dependent on the type of anions present in the subphase. Differences between Cl- and ClO4- were ascribed to the adsorption of anions according to their different hydrations and polarizabilities. The influence of a low dipole potential on the anion adsorption can be ascribed to a less positive image charge at the membrane interior, resulting from an increase in the hydrocarbon core permittivity. This is congruent with the neutralization of interfacial dipoles and the area increase, as well as with the decrease in packing of the hydrocarbon groups. Phloretin did not cause changes in the dipole potential of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), and in consequence, no effects on the zeta potential were measured. It is concluded that changes in the inner water/hydrocarbon plane affect the electrostatic potential measured in the outer plane of the polar headgroup region.},

  abstract = {Combining optimal control theory with a new RF limiting step produces pulses with significantly reduced duration and improved performance for a given maximum RF amplitude compared to previous broadband excitation by optimized pulses (BEBOP). The resulting pulses tolerate variations in RF homogeneity relevant for standard high-resolution NMR probes. Design criteria were transformation of Iz--{\textgreater}Ix over resonance offsets of +/-20kHz and RF variability of +/-5{\%}, with a pulse length of 500 micros and peak RF amplitude equal to 17.5 kHz. Simulations transform Iz to greater than 0.995 Ix, with phase deviations of the final magnetization less than 2 degrees, over ranges of resonance offset and RF variability that exceed the design targets. Experimental performance of the pulse is in excellent agreement with the simulations. Performance tradeoffs for yet shorter pulses or pulses with decreased digitization are also investigated.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) allows the production of liquid hyperpolarized substrate inside the MRI magnet bore as well as its administration in continuous flow mode to acquire MR images with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. We implemented inversion recovery preparation in order to improve contrast-to-noise ratio and to quantify the overall imaging performance of Overhauser DNP-enhanced MRI.

METHOD: The negative enhancement created by DNP in combination with inversion recovery (IR) preparation allows canceling selectively the signal originated from Boltzmann magnetization and visualizing only hyperpolarized fluid. The theoretical model describing gain of MR image intensity produced by steady-state continuous flow DNP hyperpolarized magnetization was established and proved experimentally.

RESULTS: A precise quantification of signal originated purely from DNP hyperpolarization was achieved. A temperature effect on longitudinal relaxation had to be taken into account to fit experimental results with numerical prediction.

CONCLUSION: Using properly adjusted IR preparation, the complete zeroing of thermal background magnetization was achieved, providing an essential increase of contrast-to-noise ratio of DNP-hyperpolarized water images. To quantify and optimize the steady-state conditions for MRI with continuous flow DNP, an approach similar to that incorporating transient-state thermal magnetization equilibrium in spoiled fast field echo imaging sequences can be used.

abstract = {Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a recently discovered ubiquitous eubacterial retinal-binding light-driven proton pump. Almost 1000 PR variants are widely distributed in species of marine and freshwater bacteria, suggesting PR's important photobiological role. PR is a typical seven-transmembrane [alpha]-helical membrane protein and as such poses a significant challenge to structural studies. Attempts to crystallize PR have not been successful, and its three-dimensional structure remains unknown. We show that PR reconstituted in lipids gives well-resolved magic-angle spinning NMR spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio. We report sequential assignment of 13C and 15N backbone and side-chain chemical shifts for 103 of 238 residues in PR, achieved by three-dimensional chemical shift correlation experiments performed on two samples with different patterns of reverse labeling. The chemical shift analysis gives a number of important structural insights not available from other studies: we have established protonation states of several carboxylic acids, identified the boundaries and distortions of transmembrane [alpha]-helices, and detected secondary structure elements in the loops. We confirmed that internal Asp227, which was proposed to form part of the Schiff base counterion, is ionized, while Glu142, which is located close to the extracellular surface, is neutral, in agreement with earlier predictions. We infer that, similar to bacteriorhodopsin's structure, PR has a proline kink in helix C, a non-proline kink in helix G, a short [beta]-turn in the B-C loop, and a short [alpha]-helical segment in the E-F loop.},

abstract = {(15)N-(1)H spin relaxation is a powerful method for deriving information on protein dynamics. The traditional method of data analysis is model-free (MF), where the global and local N-H motions are independent and the local geometry is simplified. The common MF analysis consists of fitting single-field data. The results are typically field-dependent, and multifield data cannot be fit with standard fitting schemes. Cases where known functional dynamics has not been detected by MF were identified by us and others. Recently we applied to spin relaxation in proteins the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) approach, which accounts rigorously for mode mixing and general features of local geometry. SRLS was shown to yield MF in appropriate asymptotic limits. We found that the experimental spectral density corresponds quite well to the SRLS spectral density. The MF formulas are often used outside of their validity ranges, allowing small data sets to be force-fitted with good statistics but inaccurate best-fit parameters. This paper focuses on the mechanism of force-fitting and its implications. It is shown that MF analysis force-fits the experimental data because mode mixing, the rhombic symmetry of the local ordering and general features of local geometry are not accounted for. Combined multifield multitemperature data analyzed with the MF approach may lead to the detection of incorrect phenomena, and conformational entropy derived from MF order parameters may be highly inaccurate. On the other hand, fitting to more appropriate models can yield consistent physically insightful information. This requires that the complexity of the theoretical spectral densities matches the integrity of the experimental data. As shown herein, the SRLS spectral densities comply with this requirement.},

  abstract = {A hybrid two-dimensional relaxometry (2DR) sequence was used to simultaneously measure both the spin-spin (R2) and spin-lattice relaxation rates (R1) of skeletal muscle in vivo. The 2DR sequence involved a 180 degrees inversion pulse followed by a variable delay time (30 values from 40 to 7000 ms); a projection presaturation (PP) scheme to localize a 16-ml cylindrical voxel; and a CPMG sequence (950 even echoes, effective echo spacing = 1.2 ms, equilibrium time = 12 s). The 2DR data were collected at 3.0 Tesla from the flexor digitorum profundus of eight healthy males, 26 +/- 2 years old. Analysis was performed with a 2D version of the non-negative least-squares algorithm and a one-way ANOVA. All subjects exhibited at least three spin-groups (R2 {\textless} 200 s(-1)), designated B, C, and D, with R2 values of 42.7, 26.5, and 8.1 s(-1), and fractional volumes of 52, 35, and 7{\%}, respectively. The R1 values of B and C were similar, congruent with0.7 s(-1), but different from that of D (P {\textless} 0.001), which had an R1 of 1.0 s(-1). The results suggest that exchange between B and C ranges from 0.7-16.2 s(-1), while exchange between either of these spin-groups with D is slower. If the data are interpreted with a compartment model, in which spin-groups with short and long R2 values are attributed to extra- and intracellular fluid, respectively, the exchange of water across the cell membrane in living skeletal muscle is slow or intermediate relative to both R1 and R2.},

  abstract = {A review. Supramol. complexes can be studied by a variety of spectroscopic methods and substantial information obtained by optical methods, by NMR spectroscopy, and by other techniques, elucidating structure and their stability, are reported in the scientific literature. However, very few data can be found concerning the rates by which these aggregates are formed or dissocd. into sep. species. This is due to the fact that assocn./dissocn. takes place in a frequency range that is not accessible (or it is accessible only in very peculiar situations) either to optical techniques or to NMR. Thus distinct signals from the free and complexed species are detected with optical spectroscopies, while spectra representing concn.-weighted avs. are obsd. by NMR since the exchange between free and complexed species is usually too fast in the NMR time scale. The assocn./dissocn. processes, taking place in the time range between 10-5 and 10-9 seconds, can instead be studied very conveniently by EPR spectroscopy. Thus, this technique has been found among those more suitable to investigate the kinetics of assocn. and dissocn. in supramol. chem. and has provided valuable mechanistic information on the dynamics of these processes. In this review the results of our EPR studies on the supramol. species formed in aq. solns. with the guest benzyl tert-Bu nitroxide or related nitroxides and different host systems will be reported.

  abstract = {Oxygen maps derived from electron paramagnetic resonance spectral-spatial imaging (EPRI) are based upon the relaxivity of molecular oxygen with paramagnetic spin probes. This technique can be combined with MRI to facilitate mapping of pO(2) values in specific anatomic locations with high precision. The co-registration procedure, which matches the physical and digital dimensions of EPR and MR images, may present the pO(2) map at the higher MRI resolution, exaggerating the spatial resolution of oxygen, making it difficult to precisely distinguish hypoxic regions from normoxic regions. The latter distinction is critical in monitoring the treatment of cancer by radiation and chemotherapy, since it is well-established that hypoxic regions are three or four times more resistant to treatment compared to normoxic regions. The aim of this article is to describe pO(2) maps based on the intrinsic resolution of EPRI. A spectral parameter that affects the intrinsic spatial resolution of EPRI is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) height of the gradient-free EPR absorption line in frequency-encoded imaging. In single point imaging too, the transverse relaxation times (T(2)(∗)) limit the resolution since the signal decays by exp(-t(p)/T(2)(∗)) where the delay time after excitation pulse, t(p), is related to the resolution. Although the spin densities of two point objects may be resolved at this separation, it is inadequate to evaluate quantitative changes of pO(2) levels since the linewidths are proportionately affected by pO(2). A spatial separation of at least twice this resolution is necessary to correctly identify a change in pO(2) level. In addition, the pO(2) values are blurred by uncertainties arising from spectral dimensions. Blurring due to noise and low resolution modulates the pO(2) levels at the boundaries of hypoxic and normoxic regions resulting in higher apparent pO(2) levels in hypoxic regions. Therefore, specification of intrinsic resolution and pO(2) uncertainties are necessary to interpret digitally processed pO(2) illustrations.},

We have used Monte-Carlo simulations and fitting to the synthetic data sets as well as the direct 3-D mapping of the parameter space of k(ex), p(a/b), and Deltaomega to quantitatively assess the degree of the parameter inter-dependence. The demonstrated high correlation between parameters can preclude accurate dynamics parameter estimation from NMR spin-relaxation data obtained at a single static magnetic field. The strong parameter inter-dependence can readily be overcome through acquisition of spin-relaxation data at more than one static magnetic field thereby allowing accurate assessment of conformational exchange properties.},

The dielectric results have been interpreted in terms of the phenomenological Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts [G. Williams and D. C. Watts, Trans. Faraday Soc. 66, 80 (1970); F. Alvarez, A. Alegria, and J. Colmenero, Phys. Rev. B 47, 125 (1993)] description. Because of the wide frequency range covered by DS, it provides a precise determination of dynamics over a wide temperature range and it revealed a crossover in polymer dynamics at 387 K through different dielectric parameters, viz., characteristic times, asymmetric shape parameter, and dielectric strength. Moreover, shape parameter is found to be higher in comparison to other typical polymeric systems. The characteristic relaxation times observed by QENS displayed an anomalous dependence of momentum transfer, indicating the possible existence of heterogeneities in the system even at the high temperatures. In addition, spin-lattice relaxation times, T(1), were found to be decoupled from dielectric characteristic times. Based on these results, a model was proposed to account for heterogeneities where we consider coexistence of different regions with standard polymeric behavior but with different characteristic times, leading to a distribution of relaxation times. The model is found to account for the anomalous behavior and an inherent shape parameter is found to account for the shape of alpha relaxation. This model is also found to predict the T variation of T(1) characteristic time scales at all temperatures. The origin of the heterogeneous domains is believed to lie in the microstructure of polymer chains.},

The design and characterization of the resonator are described and parameters of importance to EPR and spin manipulation are examined, including cavity quality factor, filling factor, and microwave magnetic field in the sample region. Simulated microwave electric and magnetic field distributions in the resonator are also presented and compared with qualitative measurements of the field distribution obtained by a perturbation technique. Based on EPR experiments carried out with a standard marker at room temperature and a MR resonating at 8.17 GHz, the minimum detectable number of spins was found to be 5 x 10(10) spins/GHz(1/2) despite the low MR unloaded quality factor Q0=60. The functionality of the EPR setup was further evaluated at low temperature, where the spin resonance of Cr dopants present in a GaAs wafer was detected at 2.3 K. The design and characterization of a more versatile MR targeting an improved EPR sensitivity and featuring an integrated biasing circuit for the study of samples that require an electrical contact are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The hydroxylation or epoxidation of hydrocarbons by bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs) requires the interplay of three or four protein components. How component protein interactions control catalysis, however, is not well understood. In particular, the binding sites of the reductase components on the surface of their cognate hydroxylases and the role(s) that the regulatory proteins play during intermolecular electron transfer leading to the hydroxylase reduction have been enigmatic. Here we determine the reductase binding site on the hydroxylase of a BMM enzyme, soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). We present evidence that the ferredoxin domain of the reductase binds to the canyon region of the hydroxylase, previously determined to be the regulatory protein binding site as well. The latter thus inhibits reductase binding to the hydroxylase and, consequently, intermolecular electron transfer from the reductase to the hydroxylase diiron active site. The binding competition between the regulatory protein and the reductase may serve as a control mechanism for regulating electron transfer, and other BMM enzymes are likely to adopt the same mechanism.},

The DNP factor is considered as a function of the magnetic field and as a function of the direction of the applied RF field, The equations make it possible to calculate the theoretical DNP spectra of nitroxide which is essential for the interpretation of the DNP spectra of nitroxides in a very low magnetic field, The EPR spectra obtained by field-cycling dynamic nuclear polarization with an RF field for the EPR irradiation at 64, 72, and 74 MHz for the TXO(N-14) and 62 and 66 MHz for the PCD(N-15) nitroxides are presented, The RF field for EPR saturation was applied perpendicular to the static magnetic field in order to induce pi transitions, except for the 64 and 74 MHz spectra of the TXO(N-14) nitroxide, in which the RF field was applied parallel to the static magnetic field in order to induce sigma transitions.

  abstract      = {The fluorescence lifetimes of most red emitting organic probes are under 4 nanoseconds, which is a limiting factor in studying interactions and conformational dynamics of macromolecules. In addition, the nanosecond background autofluorescence is a significant interference during fluorescence measurements in cellular environment. Therefore, red fluorophores with longer lifetimes will be immensely helpful. Azaoxa-triangulenium fluorophores ADOTA and DAOTA are red emitting small organic molecules with high quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and high limiting anisotropy. In aqueous environment, ADOTA and DAOTA absorption and emission maxima are respectively 540 nm and 556 nm, and 556 nm and 589 nm. Their emission extends beyond 700 nm. Both probes have the limiting anisotropy between 0.36-0.38 at their absorption peak. In both protic and aprotic solvents, their lifetimes are around 20 ns, making them among the longest-lived red emitting organic fluorophores. Upon labeling of avidin, streptavidin and immunoglobulin their absorption and fluorescence are red-shifted. Unlike in free form, the protein-conjugated probes have heterogeneous fluorescence decays, with the presence of both significantly quenched and unquenched populations. Despite the presence of significant local motions due to a flexible trimethylene linker, we successfully measured both intermediate nanosecond intra-protein motions and slower rotational correlation times approaching 100 ns. Their long lifetimes are unaffected by the cell membrane (hexadecyl-ADOTA) and the intra-cellular (DAOTA-Arginine) localization. Their long lifetimes also enabled successful time-gating of the cellular autofluorescence resulting in background-free fluorescence lifetime based images. ADOTA and DAOTA retain a long fluorescence lifetime when free, as protein conjugate, in membranes and inside the cell. Our successful measurements of intermediate nanosecond internal motions and long correlations times of large proteins suggest that these probes will be highly useful to study slower intra-molecular motions and interactions among macromolecules. The fluorescence lifetime facilitated gating of cellular nanosecond autofluorescence should be of considerable help in in vitro and in vivo applications.},

The method is based on sequences that consist of an initial encoding sequence that generates echoes with contributions from at least two different coherence pathways that are then both refocused many times by a long string of closely spaced identical pulses. The generated echoes quickly assume an asymptotic shape that encodes the information of interest. High signal-to-noise ratios can be achieved by averaging the large number of echoes. We demonstrate this approach with different implementations of the measurements of longitudinal relaxation time, T(1), and diffusion coefficient, D. It is shown that the method can be used for novel single-shot measurements.},

The experiments were performed on a frozen solution of Gd(+3) (S=7/2) in water/glycerol. Focusing on the central vector -1/2 --{\textgreater} vector +1/2 transition we measured the polarization transfer from the Gd(3+) electron spin to the adjacent (1)H protons. The dependence of the echo detected EPR signal on the length of the microwave irradiation at the EPR "forbidden" transition corresponding to an electron and a proton spin flip is measured for different powers, showing dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scales. A theoretical model based on the spin density matrix formalism is suggested to account for this dynamics. The central transition of the Gd(3+) ion is considered as an effective S = 1/2 system and is coupled to (1)H (I = 1/2) nuclei. Simulations based on a single electron-single nucleus four level system are shown to deviate from the experimental results and an alternative approach taking into account the more realistic multinuclei picture is shown to agree qualitatively with the experiments.},

Temperature variations  of the order parameter of a headgroup spin label DPP-Tempo in DOPC in  excess water and partially dehydrated (10 wt {\%} water) show a cusp-like  pattern around the main phase transition, Tc. This pattern is similar  to those of temperature variations of the quadrupolar splitting of  interbilayer D2O in PC and PE bilayers previously measured by 2H NMR,  indicating that the ordering of the headgroup and the interbilayer  water are correlated. The cusp-like pattern of these and other physical  properties around Tc are suggestive of quasicritical fluctuations.  Also, an increase (a decrease) in ordering of DPP-Tempo is correlated  with water moving out of (into) interbilayer region into (from) the  bulk water phase near the freezing point, Tf. Addition of cholesterol  lowers Tf, which remains the point of increasing headgroup ordering.  Using the small water-soluble spin probe 4-PT, it is shown that the  ordering of interbilayer water increases with bilayer dehydration. It  is suggested that increased ordering in the interbilayer region,  implying a lowering of entropy, will itself lead to further dehydration  of the interbilayer region until its lowered pressure resists further  flow, i.e., an osmotic phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Current biopharmaceutical manufacturing systems are not compatible with portable or distributed production of biologics, as they typically require the development of single biologic-producing cell lines followed by their cultivation at very large scales. Therefore, it remains challenging to treat patients in short time frames, especially in remote locations with limited infrastructure. To overcome these barriers, we developed a platform using genetically engineered Pichia pastoris strains designed to secrete multiple proteins on programmable cues in an integrated, benchtop, millilitre-scale microfluidic device. We use this platform for rapid and switchable production of two biologics from a single yeast strain as specified by the operator. Our results demonstrate selectable and near-single-dose production of these biologics in {\$}{\textless}{\$}24 h with limited infrastructure requirements. We envision that combining this system with analytical, purification and polishing technologies could lead to a small-scale, portable and fully integrated personal biomanufacturing platform that could advance disease treatment at point-of-care.},

abstract = {Allostery is an intrinsic property of many globular proteins and enzymes that is indispensable for cellular regulatory and feedback mechanisms. Recent theoretical and empirical observations indicate that allostery is also manifest in intrinsically disordered proteins, which account for a substantial proportion of the proteome. Many intrinsically disordered proteins are promiscuous binders that interact with multiple partners and frequently function as molecular hubs in protein interaction networks. The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein is a prime example of a molecular hub intrinsically disordered protein. E1A can induce marked epigenetic reprogramming of the cell within hours after infection, through interactions with a diverse set of partners that include key host regulators such as the general transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP), its paralogue p300, and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb; also called RB1). Little is known about the allosteric effects at play in E1A-CBP-pRb interactions, or more generally in hub intrinsically disordered protein interaction networks. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study coupled binding and folding processes in the ternary E1A system. The low concentrations used in these high-sensitivity experiments proved to be essential for these studies, which are challenging owing to a combination of E1A aggregation propensity and high-affinity binding interactions. Our data revealed that E1A-CBP-pRb interactions have either positive or negative cooperativity, depending on the available E1A interaction sites. This striking cooperativity switch enables fine-tuning of the thermodynamic accessibility of the ternary versus binary E1A complexes, and may permit a context-specific tuning of associated downstream signalling outputs. Such a modulation of allosteric interactions is probably a common mechanism in molecular hub intrinsically disordered protein function.},

  abstract = {NMR Hamiltonians are anisotropic due to their orientation dependence with respect to the strong, static magnetic field. They are best represented by product of two rank-2 tensors: one is the space-part tensor T and the other is the spin-part tensor A. We reformulated the dot product of Cartesian tensors and the dyadic product of spherical tensors in NMR Hamiltonian as the double contraction of these two tensors. As the double contract has two definitions (double inner product and double outer product of two rank-2 tensors), there are two sets of spherical tensor components in terms of Cartesian tensor components for any rank-2 tensor, two Cartesian Hamiltonians, and two spherical Hamiltonians. We succeeded in determining the spherical components of tensors A and T that verify the Cartesian Hamiltonian defined by the double inner product of two rank-2 tensors and the spherical Hamiltonian defined by the double outer product of two rank-2 tensors. In particular, we established the spherical components of space-part tensor T in terms of Cartesian tensor components provided by Cook and De Lucia.

  abstract = {MRI has provided significant clinical utility in the diagnosis of diseases and will become a powerful tool to assess phenotypic changes in genetically engineered animals. Overhauser enhanced MRI (OMRI), which is a double resonance technique, creates images of free radical distributions in small animals by enhancing the water proton signal intensity by means of the Overhauser effect. Several studies have demonstrated noninvasive assessment of reactive oxygen species generation in small animals by using low frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy/imaging and nitroxyl radicals. In vivo ESR signal intensities of nitroxyl radicals decrease with time after injection; and the decreases are enhanced by reactive oxygen species, generated in oxidative disease models in a site-specific manner. In this study, we show images of nitroxyl radicals with different isotopes by changing the external magnetic field for ESR irradiation between N-14 and N-15 nuclei in field-cycled OMRI. OMRI simultaneously obtained dual images of two individual chemical processes. Oxidation and reduction were monitored in a rate-dependent manner at nanometer scale by labeling membrane-permeable and -impermeable nitroxyl radicals with N-14 and N-15 nuclei. Phantom objects containing ascorbic acid-encapsulated liposomes with membrane-permeable radicals but not membrane-impermeable ones show a time-dependent decrease of the OMRI image intensity. The pharmacokinetics in mice was assessed with OMRI after radical administration. This OMRI technique with dual probes should offer significant applicability to nanometer scale molecular imaging and simultaneous assessment of independent processes in gene-modified animals. Thus, it may become a powerful tool to clarify mechanisms of disease and to monitor pharmaceutical therapy.},

  abstract  = {Fluorescent particles are routinely used to probe biological processes. The quantum properties of single spins within fluorescent particles have been explored in the field of nanoscale magnetometry, but not yet in biological environments. Here, we demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance of individual fluorescent nanodiamond nitrogen-vacancy centres inside living human HeLa cells, and measure their location, orientation, spin levels and spin coherence times with nanoscale precision. Quantum coherence was measured through Rabi and spin-echo sequences over long ({\textgreater}10 h) periods, and orientation was tracked with effective 1° angular precision over acquisition times of 89 ms. The quantum spin levels served as fingerprints, allowing individual centres with identical fluorescence to be identified and tracked simultaneously. Furthermore, monitoring decoherence rates in response to changes in the local environment may provide new information about intracellular processes. The experiments reported here demonstrate the viability of controlled single spin probes for nanomagnetometry in biological systems, opening up a host of new possibilities for quantum-based imaging in the life sciences.},

METHODS: Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) with various amounts of cholesterol were prepared by the film method and characterised by photon correlation spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. The transport of the hydrophilic spin probe encapsulated in MLV into pig ear skin was investigated by EPR imaging methods. The bilayer domain structure was studied by fitting the lineshape of the experimental EPR spectra with the spectra calculated by the model, which takes into account the heterogeneous structure of the bilayer with several coexisting domains. RESULTS: Cholesterol strongly influences the entrapped volume of liposomes, the domain structure of the lipid bilayer, and the transport of hydrophilic spin probe into the skin. Transport was not observed for liposomes composed of phospholipid:cholesterol 1:0 or 9:1 (mol:mol), not even above the phase transition temperature from the gel to the liquid crystalline phase of DMPC. A significant delivery of hydrophilic spin probe was observed only if there was 30 or 50 mol{\%} of cholesterol in the liposome bilayer. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the domain structure of the liposome bilayer is more important for the delivery of encapsulated substance into the skin than the liquid crystalline phase of the pure phospholipids bilayer.},

We apply pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy and site-directed spin labeling in what to our knowledge is a new approach to study aggregation and to identify regions on protein surfaces that participate in weak, but specific molecular interactions. As a test case, we have probed the self-association of the chemotaxis kinase CheA, which forms signaling clusters with chemoreceptors and the coupling protein CheW at the poles of bacterial cells. By measuring the intermolecular dipolar interactions sensed by spin-labels distributed over the protein surface, we show that the soluble CheA kinase aggregates to a small extent through interactions mediated by its regulatory (P5) domain. Direct dipolar distance measurements confirm that a hydrophobic surface at the periphery of P5 subdomain 2 associates CheA dimers in solution. This result is further supported by differential disulfide cross-linking from engineered cysteine reporter sites. We suggest that the periphery of P5 is an interaction site on CheA for other similar hydrophobic surfaces and plays an important role in structuring the signaling particle. ?? 2012 Biophysical Society.},

The confining cylindrical wall is hydrophilic and disordered, which has a destabilizing effect on ordered water structure. The phase diagram for this class of systems is derived from general arguments, with parameters taken from experimental observations and computer simulations and with assumptions tested by computer simulation. Phase space divides into three regions: a single liquid, a crystal-like solid, and glass. For large pores, radii exceeding 1 nm, water exhibits liquid and crystal-like behaviors, with abrupt crossovers between these regimes. For small pore radii, crystal-like behavior is unstable and water remains amorphous for all non-zero temperatures. At low enough temperatures, these states are glasses. Several experimental results for supercooled water can be understood in terms of the phase diagram we present.},

  abstract  = {The aggregation of soluble proteins into fibrillar species is a complex process that spans many lengths and time scales, and that involves the formation of numerous on-pathway and off-pathway intermediate species. Despite this complexity, several elements underlying the aggregation process appear to be universal. The kinetics typically follows a nucleation-growth process, and proteins with very different sequences aggregate to form similar fibril structures, populating intermediates with sufficient structural similarity to bind to a common antibody. This review focuses on a computational approach that exploits the common features of aggregation to simplify or 'coarse-grain' the representation of the protein. We highlight recent developments in coarse-grained modeling and illustrate how these models have been able to shed new light into the mechanisms of protein aggregation and the nature of aggregation intermediates. The roles of aggregation prone conformations in the monomeric state and the influence of inherent $\beta$-sheet and aggregation propensities in modulating aggregation pathways are discussed.},

Since this is a one-dimensional experiment, the (T(1)/T(2))T(2) ratio can be acquired, potentially, in just two scans; the second scan being a reference CPMG measurement. Conventionally, T(1)/T(2) is determined from a two-dimensional T(1)-T(2) relaxation correlation experiment. The method described here offers a significant reduction in experimental time without a reduction in signal-to-noise. The (T(1)/T(2)) ratio is useful for comparing the behaviour of liquids in porous media. Here we demonstrate the application of the DECPMG sequence to the study of oil-bearing rocks by differentiating oil or water saturated rock cores, and by observing the relative strengths of surface interaction for water in two types of rock by measuring (T(1)/T(2)) as a function of magnetic field strength.},

  abstract      = {The most widely used free radicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments or related Overhauser imaging are nitroxides. The DNP parameters in biological fluids were measured in order to provide guidelines for the design of new nitroxides, adapted to the biological applications of DNP. Eighteen nitroxides were studied at a concentration of 1 mM. Extrapolation at complete electron paramagnetic resonance saturation and proton longitudinal-relaxation-time measurements enable calculation of the coupling factor between nitroxide free electrons and water protons. In deoxygenated phosphate-buffered solutions, the NMR signal enhancement by DNP ranged from -36.3 to -6.7, and the coupling factor ranged from 0.31 to 0.03, Nitroxides with a long side chain yield poor enhancement, although their relaxivity is far greater than that of nitroxides with small chains. In a I mM albumin solution, the loss in enhancement factor is mainly caused by the fact that proton relaxation occurs via interactions, not only with the dissolved free radicals but also with the albumin macromolecules. In serum, the enhancement factor is lower than that in an albumin solution, because of the higher protein concentration in serum. In red-blood-cell suspensions, the enhancement factor was further decreased, Two effects contribute to this decrease: first, the increased viscosity due to the presence of red blood cells, and second, the susceptibility effects of the paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin. The high sensitivity to oxygen of DNP in phosphate-buffered solution is also greatly reduced when nitroxides are dissolved in blood, In red-blood-cell solutions there is competition between the removal of O-2, which favors proton relaxation by the free radical, and the increase of deoxyhemoglobin, which provides the water protons with another sink of relaxation, On the basis of this study, the properties of nitroxides for use in biological application must fulfill four criteria; i.e., they must have an EPR linewidth narrower than 100 mG, a relaxivity greater than 2.5 (mM s)(-1), a good stability with a half-life time in biological fluids exceeding 1 hour, and low toxicity, (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

With a focus on this function, we have worked along with others to develop diverse and increasingly sophisticated tools to analyse the complexity of membrane structure that facilitates regulation and targeting of signalling events. The present chapter describes how initial membrane interactions of clustered IgE-FcɛRI lead to downstream cellular responses and how biochemical information integrated with nanoscale resolution spectroscopy and imaging is providing mechanistic insights at the level of molecular complexes.},

  abstract = {Three nitroxide spin probes of different sizes and geometrical shape were used in a 250 GHz ESR study of the probe rotational dynamics in the fragile glass former ortho-terphenyl (OTP) over a wide temperature range from 380 to 180 K. Comparative studies at 9.5 GHz have also been performed. Perdeuterated 2,2',6,6'-tetramethyl-4-methyl aminopiperidinyl-N-oxide (MOTA), and 3,3'-dimethyloxazolidinyl-N-oxy-2',3-5 alpha-cholestane (CSL) are, respectively, comparable in size to and larger than the OTP host molecule, whereas Perdeuterated 2,,2',6,6'-tetramethyl-4-piperidine-N-oxide (PDT) is substantially smaller. The sensitivity of 250 GHz ESR to the details of the rotational tumbling for T greater than or similar to T-c (where T-c is the crossover temperature) was exploited to show that the relaxation is fit by a model that is characteristic of a homogeneous liquid. A nonlinear least-squares analysis shows that below the melting point, T-m, CSL, and MOTA dynamics are well-described by a model of dynamic cage relaxation proposed by Polimeno and Freed wherein the probe relaxation is significantly influenced by a fluctuating potential well coated by the neighboring OTP molecules. A model of simple Brownian reorientation does not fit the experimental spectra of CSL or MOTA as well as the dynamic cage model below T-m. Spectra of PDT do not show any significant non-Brownian dynamics for this probe. It was found that the characteristic rates of the cage model, viz., the reorientation of the probe and the cage relaxation, were describable by activated processes; however, the ''average'' rotational diffusion rates (defined in the usual manner as the time integral of the correlation function) derived from the dynamic cage parameters follow the Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relation rather well, in agreement with previous studies by other physical techniques. It is then shown that the usual stretched exponential fit to the motional correlation function, interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous distribution of simple reorientational rates, is clearly inconsistent with the observed ESR spectrum. The absence of a significant cage potential above T-m is discussed in terms of a model of frustration limited domain sizes proposed by Kivelson and co-workers. Evidence for the existence of substantial voids in OTP below T-m, especially from the spectra of the small PDT probe, is discussed in terms of the structure and packing of the OTP solvent.

abstract = {Complex coacervation is a phenomenon characterized by the association of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes into micrometer-scale liquid condensates. This process is the purported first step in the formation of underwater adhesives by sessile marine organisms, as well as the process harnessed for the formation of new synthetic and protein-based contemporary materials. Efforts to understand the physical nature of complex coacervates are important for developing robust adhesives, injectable materials, or novel drug delivery vehicles for biomedical applications; however, their internal fluidity necessitates the use of in situ characterization strategies of their local dynamic properties, capabilities not offered by conventional techniques such as X-ray scattering, microscopy, or bulk rheological measurements. Herein, we employ the novel magnetic resonance technique Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (DNP), together with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) line shape analysis, to concurrently quantify local molecular and hydration dynamics, with species- and site-specificity. We observe striking differences in the structure and dynamics of the protein-based biomimetic complex coacervates from their synthetic analogues, which is an asymmetric collapse of the polyelectrolyte constituents. From this study we suggest charge heterogeneity within a given polyelectrolyte chain to be an important parameter by which the internal structure of complex coacervates may be tuned. Acquiring molecular-level insight to the internal structure and dynamics of dynamic polymer complexes in water through the in situ characterization of site- and species-specific local polymer and hydration dynamics should be a promising general approach that has not been widely employed for materials characterization.},

Data obtained by saturating the nitroxide EPR line at a field-frequency combination determined after employing the Breit-Rabi formalism are most satisfactory provided low radical concentrations are used. Ratio method determinations of ultimate enhancements are appropriate in most cases, although application of an exchange-based model by using data on the broadening of spectra as the spin-label concentration is increased may provide a means of determining ultimate enhancements when the ratio method is not applicable. Studies with several nitroxide radicals show that similar species give polarization results that do not change when substituents far removed from the localized unpaired electron are changed. Perfluoropyridine is shown to exhibit increased scalar-dominated polarization with more aromatic nitroxides as has been observed for hexafluorobenzene; the dipolar-dominated enhancements for both monofluorobenzene and 2-fluoropyridine are also similar.},

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

  abstract      = {Liquid state Overhauser effect Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) has experienced a recent resurgence of interest. The ODNP technique described here relies on the double resonance of electron spin resonance (ESR) at the most common, i.e. X-band (∼10GHz), frequency and ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at ∼15 MHz. It requires only a standard continuous wave (cw) ESR spectrometer with an NMR probe inserted or built into an X-band cavity. We focus on reviewing a new and powerful manifestation of ODNP as a high frequency NMR relaxometry tool that probes dipolar cross relaxation between the electron spins and the ¹H nuclear spins at X-band frequencies. This technique selectively measures the translational mobility of water within a volume extending 0.5-1.5 nm outward from a nitroxide radical spin probe that is attached to a targeted site of a macromolecule. It allows one to study the dynamics of water that hydrates or permeates the surface or interior of proteins, polymers, and lipid membrane vesicles. We begin by reviewing the recent advances that have helped develop ODNP into a tool for mapping the dynamic landscape of hydration water with sub-nanometer locality. In order to bind this work coherently together and to place it in the context of the extensive body of research in the field of NMR relaxometry, we then rephrase the analytical model and extend the description of the ODNP-derived NMR signal enhancements. This extended model highlights several aspects of ODNP data analysis, including the importance of considering all possible effects of microwave sample heating, the need to consider the error associated with various relaxation rates, and the unique ability of ODNP to probe the electron-¹H cross-relaxation process, which is uniquely sensitive to fast (tens of ps) dynamical processes. By implementing the relevant corrections in a stepwise fashion, this paper draws a consensus result from previous ODNP procedures and then shows how such data can be further corrected to yield clear and reproducible saturation of the NMR hyperpolarization process. Finally, drawing on these results, we broadly survey the previous ODNP dynamics literature. We find that the vast number of published, empirical hydration dynamics data can be reproducibly classified into regimes of surface, interfacial, vs. buried water dynamics.},

abstract = {Genome packaging into preformed viral procapsids is driven by powerful molecular motors. The small terminase protein is essential for the initial recognition of viral DNA and regulates the motor's ATPase and nuclease activities during DNA translocation. The crystal structure of a full-length small terminase protein from the Siphoviridae bacteriophage SF6, comprising the N-terminal DNA binding, the oligomerization core, and the C-terminal beta-barrel domains, reveals a nine-subunit circular assembly in which the DNA-binding domains are arranged around the oligomerization core in a highly flexible manner. Mass spectrometry analysis and four further crystal structures show that, although the full-length protein exclusively forms nine-subunit assemblies, protein constructs missing the C-terminal beta-barrel form both nine-subunit and ten-subunit assemblies, indicating the importance of the C terminus for defining the oligomeric state. The mechanism by which a ring-shaped small terminase oligomer binds viral DNA has not previously been elucidated. Here, we probed binding in vitro by using EPR and surface plasmon resonance experiments, which indicated that interaction with DNA is mediated exclusively by the DNA-binding domains and suggested a nucleosome-like model in which DNA binds around the outside of the protein oligomer.},

The surfaces contain either a microscale pattern of micropillars or a random nanofibrillar pattern. Nanoscale asperities on top of the micropillars closely resemble Nelumbo nucifera lotus leaves. The evolution of the contact angle of water and lysozyme solution droplets during evaporation was studied on the micro- and nanopatterned surfaces, showing in particular contact-line pinning for the protein solution droplet on the nanopatterned surface. The microstructural evolution of lysozyme solution droplets was studied on both types of surfaces in situ under nearly contact-free conditions by synchrotron radiation microbeam wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering revealing the increasing protein concentration and the onset of precipitation. The solid residuals show hollow sphere morphologies. Rastermicrodiffraction of the detached residuals suggests about a 1/3 volume fraction of ≥17 nm lysozyme nanocrystalline domains and about a 2/3 short-range-order volume fraction. About 5-fold larger nanocrystalline domains were observed at the attachment points of the sphere to the substrates, which is attributed to particle growth in a shear flow. Such surfaces represent nearly contact-free sample supports for studies of inorganic and organic solution droplets, which find applications in biochips.},

abstract = {The model of microscopic order and macroscopic disorder was used to stimulate electron spin resonance spectra of spin-labeled lipids, 5-PC, 10-PC, and 16-PC in multilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) containing gramicidin A' (GA) at temperatures above the gel-to-liquid crystal transition of DPPC. The simulations show that at a lower concentration of GA (i.e., molar ratios of DPPC/GA greater than 3), GA has only a slight effect on the acyl chain dynamics. The rotational diffusion rate around the axis parallel to the long hydrocarbon chain remains unchanged or increases slightly, while the rate around the perpendicular axes decreases slightly. These spectra from DPPC/GA mixtures could only be fit successfully with two or more components consistent with the well-known concept of "boundary lipids," that is, the peptide induces structural inhomogeneity in lipid bilayers. However, the spectra were significantly better fit with additional components that exhibit increased local ordering, implying decreased amplitude of rotational motion, rather than immobilized components with sharply a reduced rotational rate. The largest relative effects occur at the end of the acyl chains, where the average local order parameter St of 16-PC increases from 0.06 for pure lipid to 0.66 for 1:1 DPPC/GA. The inhomogeneity in ordering in DPPC bilayers due to GA decreases with increasing temperature. The hyperfine tensor component Azz increases for 10-PC and 16-PC when GA is incorporated into DPPC bilayers, indicating that water has deeply penetrated into the DPPC bilayers. Simulations of published electron spin resonance spectra of 14-PC in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/cytochrome oxidase complexes were also better fit by additional components that were more ordered, rather than immobilized. The average local order parameter in this case is found to increase from 0.11 for pure dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine to 0.61 for a lipid/protein ratio of 50. These spectra and their simulations are similar to the results obtained with 16-PC in the DPPC/GA mixtures. The relevance to studies of lipid-protein interactions for other proteins is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Proton electron double resonance imaging (PEDRI) uses the Overhauser effect to image the distribution of free-radicals in biological samples and animals. Standard MRI hardware and software is used, with the addition of hardware to irradiate the free-radical-of-interest's EPR resonance. For in vivo applications it must be implemented at a sufficiently low magnetic field to result in an EPR irradiation frequency that will penetrate the sample but will not cause excessive nonresonant power deposition therein. Many clinical MRI systems use resistive magnets that are capable of operating at 10-20 mT, and which could thus be used as PEDRI imagers with the addition of a small amount of extra hardware. This article describes the conversion of a 0.38 T whole-body MRI system for operation as a 20.1 mT small-animal PEDRI imager. The magnet power supply control electronics required a small modification to operate at the lower field strength, but no permanent hardware changes to the MRI console were necessary, and no software modification was required. Frequency down- and up-conversion was used on the NMR RF system, together with a new NMR/EPR dual-resonance RF coil assembly.

In particular, nitroxide spin label studies with high-field/high-frequency ESR and two-dimensional Fourier transform ESR enable one to accurately determine distances in biomolecules, unravel the details of the complex dynamics in proteins, characterize the dynamic structure of membrane domains, and discriminate between bulk lipids and boundary lipids that coat transmembrane peptides or proteins; these studies can also provide time resolution to studies of functional dynamics of proteins. We illustrate these capabilities with recent examples.},

  abstract = {Allosteric regulation of protein function is a mechanism by which an event in one place of a protein structure causes an effect at another site, much like the behavior of a telecommunications network in which a collection of transmitters, receivers and transceivers communicate with each other across long distances. For example, ligand binding or an amino acid mutation at an allosteric site can alter enzymatic activity or binding affinity in a distal region such as the active site or a second binding site. The mechanism of this site-to-site communication is of great interest, especially since allosteric effects must be considered in drug design and protein engineering. In this review, conformational mobility as the common route between allosteric regulation and catalysis is discussed. We summarize recent experimental data and the resulting insights into allostery within proteins, and we discuss the nature of future studies and the new applications that may result from increased understanding of this regulatory mechanism.},

  abstract      = {Regulation of protein function is often linked to a conformational switch triggered by chemical or physical signals. To evaluate such conformational changes and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of subsequent protein function, experimental identification of conformational substates and characterization of conformational equilibria are mandatory. We apply pressure modulation in combination with FTIR spectroscopy to reveal equilibria between spectroscopically resolved substates of the lipidated signaling protein N-Ras. Pressure has the advantage that its thermodynamic conjugate is volume, a parameter that is directly related to structure. The conformational dynamics of N-Ras in its different nucleotide binding states in the absence and presence of a model biomembrane was probed by pressure perturbation. We show that not only nucleotide binding but also the presence of the membrane has a drastic effect on the conformational dynamics and selection of conformational substates of the protein, and a new substate appearing upon membrane binding could be uncovered. Population of this new substate is accompanied by structural reorientations of the G domain, as also indicated by complementary ATR-FTIR and IRRAS measurements. These findings thus illustrate that the membrane controls signaling conformations by acting as an effective interaction partner, which has consequences for the G-domain orientation of membrane-associated N-Ras, which in turn is known to be critical for its effector and modulator interactions. Finally, these results provide insights into the influence of pressure on Ras-controlled signaling events in organisms living under extreme environmental conditions as they are encountered in the deep sea where pressures reach the kbar range.},

  abstract  = {This paper reports on a significant improvement of a new structural biology approach designed to probe the secondary structure of membrane proteins using the pulsed EPR technique of electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy. Previously, we showed that we could characterize an $\alpha$-helical secondary structure with ESEEM spectroscopy using a (2)H-labeled Val side chain coupled with site-directed spin-labeling (SDSL). In order to further develop this new approach, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were conducted on several different hydrophobic residues that are commonly found in membrane proteins. (2)H-SL distance distributions from the MD results indicated that (2)H-labeled Leu was a very strong candidate to significantly improve this ESEEM approach. In order to test this hypothesis, the secondary structure of the $\alpha$-helical M2$\delta$ peptide of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) incorporated into a bicelle was investigated with (2)H-labeled Leu d(10) at position 10 (i) and nitroxide spin labels positioned 1, 2, 3, and 4 residues away (denoted i+1 to i+4) with ESEEM spectroscopy. The ESEEM data reveal a unique pattern that is characteristic of an $\alpha$-helix (3.6 residues per turn). Strong (2)H modulation was detected for the i+3 and i+4 samples, but not for the i+2 sample. The (2)H modulation depth observed for (2)H-labeled d(10) Leu was significantly enhanced (×4) when compared to previous ESEEM measurements that used (2)H-labeled d(8) Val. Computational studies indicate that deuterium nuclei on the Leu side chain are closer to the spin label when compared to Val. The enhancement of (2)H modulation and the corresponding Fourier Transform (FT) peak intensity for (2)H-labeled Leu significantly reduces the ESEEM data acquisition time for Leu when compared to Val. This research demonstrates that a different (2)H-labeled amino acid residue can be used as an efficient ESEEM probe further substantiating this important biophysical technique. Finally, this new method can provide pertinent qualitative structural information on membrane proteins in a short time (few minutes) at low sample concentrations ({\~{}}50 $\mu$M).},

A charge transfer mechanism between the unsaturated organic molecules and these defects is responsible for the subsequent chemical events. Intramolecular rearrangement of the 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene radical cation yields a more stable 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene isomer radical cation, whereas aromatization of the 2-butyne radical cation forms hexamethylbenzene radical cation at higher temperatures. On the basis of direct observations of these chemical reactions, both the solid-state defects and various pathways of radical cations should play an interesting role in understanding zeolite catalysis.},

The method uses low temperature, high magnetic field, and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to strongly polarize nuclear spins in the solid state. The solid sample is subsequently dissolved rapidly in a suitable solvent to create a solution of molecules with hyperpolarized nuclear spins. The polarization is performed in a DNP polarizer, consisting of a super-conducting magnet (3.35 T) and a liquid-helium cooled sample space. The sample is irradiated with microwaves at approximate to94 GHz. Subsequent to polarization, the sample is dissolved by an injection system inside the DNP magnet. The dissolution process effectively preserves the nuclear polarization. The resulting hyperpolarized liquid sample can be transferred to a high-resolution NMR spectrometer, where an enhanced NMR signal can be acquired, or it may be used as an agent for in vivo imaging or spectroscopy. In this article we describe the use of the method on aqueous solutions of [C-13]urea. Polarizations of 37{\%} for C-13 and 7.8{\%} for N-15, respectively, were obtained after the dissolution. These polarizations correspond to an enhancement of 44,000 for C-13 and 23,500 for N-15, respectively, compared with thermal equilibrium at 9.4 T and room temperature. The method can be used generally for signal enhancement and reduction of measurement time in liquid-state NMR and opens up for a variety of in vitro and in vivo applications of DNP-enhanced NMR.},

We examined the transient response characteristics of a commercial frequency multiplier and found that the device can function as a multiplier for pulsed signal even though it was designed for continuous wave operation. We applied the technique to a Ku band pulsed EPR spectrometer and successfully observed a spin echo signal with a broad excitation bandwidth of approximately 1.6mT using 80 degrees pulses of 1.5ns.},

  abstract = {In a previous communication [Hu , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126, 10844 (2004)], an approach was demonstrated that improves the efficiency of the cross-effect polarization mechanism employed in high field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments. Specifically, it was shown that tethering two TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl) radicals increases the electron-electron dipole coupling from similar to 1 MHz in solutions of monomeric TEMPO to similar to 25 MHz in a tethered biradical. The larger coupling resulted in an increase in the DNP enhancements by a factor of similar to 3-4, from 45-50 to similar to 165. Here, a second approach to improving the efficiency of the polarization process is described that involves approximately satisfying the matching condition parallel to omega(2e)-omega(1e)parallel to=omega(n), where omega(2e) and omega(1e) are two frequencies in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum and omega(n) is the Larmor frequency of the nuclear spins being polarized. Specifically, in a mixture of TEMPO and trityl [tris (8-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl(-d3)-benzo[1,2d:4,5-d']bis(1,3)dithiol-4-yl) methyl] radicals, the intensity maxima in the EPR spectra of these two species are approximately separated by the H-1 NMR frequency. In this case the frequency difference between the g(yy) value of TEMPO and the narrow pseudo-isotropic g-value of trityl is similar to 224 MHz and the H-1 Larmor frequency is 211 MHz. The optimal magnetic field for DNP using the mixtures was found to coincide with the trityl EPR resonance. At 90 K and 5 T, a mixture of 20 mM TEMPO and 20 mM trityl enhanced the H-1 polarization by a factor of similar to 160, an improvement over the enhancement of similar to 50 with 40 mM TEMPO. The reasons for the improvement are discussed and evidence is presented suggesting that DNP enhancement can be improved further by tethering TEMPO and trityl or two similar radicals.

Here, we use computer simulation and a time correlation function technique to understand these aspects in the hydration layer of lysozyme. Water molecules in the layer are found to exhibit three distinct bond-breaking mechanisms. A large angle orientational jump of the donor water molecule is common among all of them. In the most common ( approximately 80{\%}) bond-breaking event in the layer, the new acceptor water molecule comes from the first coordination shell (initially within 3.5 A of the donor), and the old acceptor water molecule remains within the first coordination shell, even after the bond-breaking. This is in contrast to that in bulk water, in which both of the acceptor molecules involve the second coordination shell. Additionally, the motion of the incoming and the outgoing acceptor molecules involved is not diffusive in the hydration layer, in contrast to their observed diffusive motion in the bulk. The difference in rotational dynamics between the bulk and the hydration layer water molecules is clearly manifested in the calculated time-dependent angular van Hove self-correlation function ( G(theta, t)) which has a pronounced two-peak structure in the layer, and this can be traced to the constrained translational motion in the layer. The longevity of the surrounding hydrogen bond network is found to be significantly enhanced near a hydrophilic residue.},

Twenty-eight of the 120 peptide amide hydrogens were found to be at least partially protected from exchange during approximately 1 year required for crystal preparation and data collection. Most of the protected hydrogens were involved in hydrogen bonds with main-chain carbonyl groups. A contiguous region of the beta-sheet containing residues 75, 106--109, 116, and 118 had a large number of protected hydrogens, indicating its low flexibility and the lack of accessibility to solvent. Residues 11--13 from the alpha-helix near the amino terminus were protected, in good agreement with a model of cooperative unwinding of this helix, starting from the free (amino) end.},

  abstract = {Motional effects can easily be incorporated into calculated spin echo decay envelopes by idealizing the effects of the pulses and by using the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) to govern the time dependence of the density matrix between pulses. The spectral representation of the 90 degrees - [tau] -180 degrees - [tau] envelope is: [Sigma] l,mal,mexp(-( [Lambda] l+ [Lambda] *m) [tau] ), where [Lambda] l is the lth eigenvalue of the SLE matrix, and al,m are products of relevant components of eigenvectors. The long time (large [tau] ) phase memory time Tminfinity is equal to (Re [Lambda] 1)-1, where [Lambda] l is the smallest eigenvalue. For an axially symmetric g-tensor case in the slow motional region, Tminfinity / [tau] R approximately=3 mod F [tau] R mod -12/, 2 mod F [tau] R mod -13/, and 1, for Brownian, free, and jump diffusion models, respectively, with F identical to 2 [beta] eH0(g/sub ///-gperpendicular to )/3h(cross) and [tau] R the rotational correlation time. Analogous results hold for nitroxides having nuclear hyperfine tensors. The echo results are compared with simple methods of measuring [tau] R from CW spectra. The overall shape of the echo envelopes in the slow motional region is exp(-bF2 [tau] 3/ [tau] R) for very short times and exp(-2 [tau] /Tminfinity ) for the longer times. Carr-Purcell (CP) sequences suppress the initial exponential in [tau] 3 and increase the phase memory times as a function of decreasing [tau] . Detailed analysis of CP sequences can provide information on motional model. The analysis of motional averaging of nuclear modulation effects by this method is also given and it is pointed out that this approach may be useful in studying very slow motions. Despite the simplicity of the methods, the authors are able to approximately fit experimental data from the Tempone/glycerol-water system in both fast and slow motional regions.

  abstract = {(1) The dielectric properties (complex permittivity) of suspensions of chloroplast thylakoids have been determined in the range 10 Hz to 13 MHz. In common with other charged membrane vesicles, thylakoids exhibit two broad dielectric dispersions corresponding to the classical $\alpha$- and $\beta$-dispersions. (2) Heat treatment of thylakoids, to produce blebs of a greater average radius, increases, as expected, the magnitude of the $\beta$-dispersion, but not that of the $\alpha$-dispersion. This result suggests that the $\alpha$-dispersion is not caused solely by the unrestricted tangential relaxation of the ions of the diffuse double layer. (3) The magnitude of the $\alpha$-dispersion is strongly pH-dependent, and is negligible at the pI (ca. pH 4.3–4.4) of thylakoids. The $\alpha$-dispersion is much less sensitive to pH. Measurements of the magnitude of the a dispersion may therefore be used to obtained the pI of charged membrane vesicles. (4) Both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-dispersions are significantly decreased by treatment of the thylakoids with the cross-linking reagent glutaraldehyde, suggesting that the (lateral) motions (in particular) of charged membrane components contribute to the dielectric properties in this frequency range. The relaxation times observed, however, are not consistent with the view that such motions are restricted by hydrodynamic forces alone. The breadth of the dispersion remains very large, however, suggesting also a variable restriction on the genuinely tangential motions of double ions.},

abstract = {Traditional transfection agents including cationic lipids and polymers have high efficiency but cause cytotoxicity. While cell penetrating peptide based transfection agents exhibit improved cytotoxicity profiles, they do not have the efficiency of existing lipidic agents due to endosomal trapping. As a consequence, we propose an alternative method to efficient peptide based siRNA transfection by starting with melittin, a known pore-forming peptide. By incorporating modifications to decrease cytotoxicity and improve siRNA binding, we have developed p5RHH, which can complex siRNA to form nanoparticles of 190 nm in diameter. p5RHH exhibits high efficiency with GFP knockdown at concentrations as low as 5 nM, with negligible cytotoxicity. To date, p5RHH has shown the ability to transfect B16 cells, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, and RAW264.7 cells with high efficiency. These in vitro models demonstrate that p5RHH mediated transfection can block cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and foam cell formation. Moreover, p5RHH/siRNA nanoparticles maintain their size and transfection efficiency in the presence of serum proteins suggesting the potential for use of p5RHH in vivo. These data suggest that our strategy for development of siRNA transfecting peptides can provide an avenue to safe and effective siRNA therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Hydration shells of normal proteins display regions of highly structured water as well as patches of less structured bulk-like water. Recent studies suggest that isomers with larger surface densities of patches of bulk-like water have an increased propensity to aggregate. These aggregates are toxic to the cellular environment. Hence, the early detection of these toxic deposits is of paramount medical importance. We show that various morphological states of association of such isomers can be differentiated from the normal protein background based on the characteristic partition between bulk, caged, and surface hydration water and the magnetic resonance (MR) signals of this water. We derive simple mathematical equations relating the compartmentalization of water to the local hydration fraction and the packing density of the newly formed molecular assemblies. Then, we employ these equations to predict the MR response of water constrained by protein aggregation. Our results indicate that single units and compact aggregates that contain no water between constituents induce a shift of the MR signal from normal protein background to values in the hyperintensity domain (bright spots), corresponding to bulk water. In contrast, large plaques that cage significant amounts of water between constituents are likely to generate MR responses in the hypointensity domain (dark spots), typical for strongly correlated water. The implication of these results is that amyloids can display both dark and bright spots when compared to the normal gray background tissue on MR images. In addition, our findings predict that the bright spots are more likely to correspond to amyloids in their early stage of development. The results help explain the MR contrast patterns of amyloids and suggest a new approach for identifying unusual protein aggregation related to disease.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that the hydrophobic protein surfaces in aqueous solution sit near a drying transition. The tendency for these surfaces to expel water from their vicinity leads to self-assembly of macromolecular complexes. In this article, we show with a realistic model for a biologically pertinent system how this phenomenon appears at the molecular level. We focus on the association of the C-terminal domain (CA-C) of the human immunodeficiency virus capsid protein. By combining all-atom simulations with specialized sampling techniques, we measure the water density distribution during the approach of two CA-C proteins as a function of separation and amino acid sequence in the interfacial region. The simulations demonstrate that CA-C protein-protein interactions sit at the edge of a dewetting transition and that this mesoscopic manifestation of the underlying liquid-vapor phase transition can be readily manipulated by biology or protein engineering to significantly affect association behavior. Although the wild-type protein remains wet until contact, we identify a set of in silico mutations, in which three hydrophilic amino acids are replaced with nonpolar residues, that leads to dewetting before association. The existence of dewetting depends on the size and relative locations of substituted residues separated by nanometer length scales, indicating long-range cooperativity and a sensitivity to surface topography. These observations identify important details that are missing from descriptions of protein association based on buried hydrophobic surface area.},

A stable nitroxide radical, 1-oxyl-4-bromo-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline (R5a), was attached postsynthetically to phosphorothioates that were chemically introduced, one at a time, at five sites of a DNA duplex. The two phosphorothioate diastereomers (R(p) or S(p)) were separated, and nitroxide rotational motions were monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra vary according to diastereomer identity and location of the labeling site, with R(p)-R5a spectra effectively reporting on local DNA structural features and S(p)-R5a spectra sensing variations in local DNA motions. This establishes R(p)- and S(p)-R5a as unique probes for investigating nucleic acids in a site- and stereospecific manner, which may aid studies of stereospecific DNA/protein interactions. In addition, weighted averages of individual R(p) and S(p) spectra match those of R5a attached to mixed diastereomers. This suggests that R5a linked to mixed diastereomers reports on the composite behaviors of R(p)- and S(p)-R5a and is useful in initial probing of the DNA local environment. This work advances understanding of R5a/DNA coupling, and is a key step forward in developing a nucleotide-independent spectroscopic probe for studying nucleic acids.},

Hyperactive AFPs, identified in insects, have an especially high ability to depress the freezing point by far exceeding the abilities of other AFPs. In previous studies, we postulated that the activity of AFPs can be attributed to two distinct molecular mechanisms: (i) short-range direct interaction of the protein surface with the growing ice face and (ii) long-range interaction by protein-induced water dynamics extending up to 20 {\AA} from the protein surface. In the present paper, we combine terahertz spectroscopy and molecular simulations to prove that long-range protein-water interactions make essential contributions to the high antifreeze activity of insect AFPs from the beetle Dendroides canadensis. We also support our hypothesis by studying the effect of the addition of the osmolyte sodium citrate.},

A zeroth-order regularization functional is used to incorporate a priori information about the smoothness of the parameters into the problem formulation. We adapt the Butler-Reeds-Dawson (1981) algorithm to solve this optimization problem in three steps. In the first step, the data are compressed using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the kernels. The tensor-product structure of the kernel is exploited so that the compressed data is typically a thousand fold smaller than the original data. This size reduction is crucial for fast optimization. In the second step, the constrained optimization problem is transformed to an unconstrained optimization problem in the compressed data space. In the third step, a suboptimal value of the smoothing parameter is chosen by the BRD method. Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until convergence of the algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on simulated data},

We present here a comparison of the reorientation dynamics of individual water molecules within the hydration shell of a series of globular proteins: acetylcholinesterase, subtilisin Carlsberg, lysozyme, and ubiquitin. Molecular dynamics simulations and analytical models are used to access site-resolved information on hydration shell dynamics and to elucidate the molecular origins of the dynamical perturbation of hydration shell water relative to bulk water. We show that all four proteins have very similar hydration shell dynamics, despite their wide range of sizes and functions, and differing secondary structures. We demonstrate that this arises from the similar local surface topology and surface chemical composition of the four proteins, and that such local factors alone are sufficient to rationalize the hydration shell dynamics. We propose that these conclusions can be generalized to a wide range of globular proteins. We also show that protein conformational fluctuations induce a dynamical heterogeneity within the hydration layer. We finally address the effect of confinement on hydration shell dynamics via a site-resolved analysis and connect our results to experiments via the calculation of two-dimensional infrared spectra.},

The macroscopic diffusion coefficient Dmacro for self-diffusion of 16-PC spin label is obtained from imaging the concentration profiles as a function of time, and it is (2.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(-8) cm2/s at 22 degrees C. The microscopic diffusion coefficient Dmicro for relative diffusion of the spin probes is obtained from the variation of the spectral line broadening with spin label concentration, which is due to spin-spin interactions. Dmicro is found to be substantially greater than Dmacro for the same sample at the same conditions, and is estimated to be at least (1.0 +/- 0.4) x 10(-7) cm2/s. Possible sources for their difference are briefly discussed in terms of the models used for Dmicro.},

  abstract = {Elastic incoherent neutron scattering (EINS), a non-invasive technique which is capable of measuring the mean square displacement of atoms in the sample, has been widely used in biology for exploring the dynamics of proteins and lipid membranes but studies on photosynthetic systems are scarce. In this study we investigated the dynamic characteristics of Photosystem II (PSII) membrane fragments between 280 and 340 K, i.e., in the physiological temperature range and in the range of thermal denaturation of some of the protein complexes. The mean square displacement values revealed the presence of a hydration-sensitive transition in the sample between 310 and 320 K, suggesting that the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) plays an important role in the transition. Indeed, in samples in which the OEC had been removed by TRIS- or heat-treatments (323 and 333 K) no such transition was found. Further support on the main role of OEC in these reorganizations is provided by data obtained from differential scanning calorimetry experiments, showing marked differences between the untreated and TRIS-treated samples. In contrast, circular dichroism spectra exhibited only minor changes in the excitonic interactions below 323 K, showing that the molecular organization of the pigment-protein complexes remains essentially unaffected. Our data, along with earlier incoherent neutron scattering data on PSII membranes at cryogenic temperatures (Pieper et al., Biochemistry 46:11398-11409, 2007), demonstrate that this technique can be applied to characterize the dynamic features of PSII membranes, and can be used to investigate photosynthetic membranes under physiologically relevant experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {Weak and transient protein-protein interactions underlie numerous biological processes. However, the location of the interaction sites of the specific complexes and the effect of transient, nonspecific protein-protein interactions often remain elusive. We have investigated the weak self-association of human growth hormone (hGH, KD = 0.90 ± 0.03 mM) at neutral pH by the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) of the amide protons induced by the soluble paramagnetic relaxation agent, gadodiamide (Gd(DTPA-BMA)). Primarily, it was found that the PREs are in agreement with the general Hwang-Freed model for relaxation by translational diffusion (J. Chem. Phys. 1975, 63, 4017-4025), only if crowding effects on the diffusion in the protein solution are taken into account. Second, by measuring the PREs of the amide protons at increasing hGH concentrations and a constant concentration of the relaxation agent, it is shown that a distinction can be made between residues that are affected only by transient, nonspecific protein-protein interactions and residues that are involved in specific protein-protein associations. Thus, the PREs of the former residues increase linearly with the hGH concentration in the entire concentration range because of a reduction of the diffusion caused by the transient, nonspecific protein-protein interactions, while the PREs of the latter residues increase only at the lower hGH concentrations but decrease at the higher concentrations because of specific protein-protein associations that impede the access of gadodiamide to the residues of the interaction surface. Finally, it is found that the ultraweak aggregation of hGH involves several interaction sites that are located in patches covering a large part of the protein surface.},

  abstract  = {Protein surface hydration is fundamental to its structural stability and flexibility, and water-protein fluctuations are essential to biological function. Here, we report a systematic global mapping of water motions in the hydration layer around a model protein of apomyoglobin in both native and molten globule states. With site-directed mutagenesis, we use intrinsic tryptophan as a local optical probe to scan the protein surface one at a time with single-site specificity. With femtosecond resolution, we examined 16 mutants in two states and observed two types of water-network relaxation with distinct energy and time distributions. The first water motion results from the local collective hydrogen-bond network relaxation and occurs in a few picoseconds. The initial hindered motions, observed in bulk water in femtoseconds, are highly suppressed and drastically slow down due to structured water-network collectivity in the layer. The second water-network relaxation unambiguously results from the lateral cooperative rearrangements in the inner hydration shell and occurs in tens to hundreds of picoseconds. Significantly, this longtime dynamics is the coupled interfacial water-protein motions and is the direct measurement of such cooperative fluctuations. These local protein motions, although highly constrained, are necessary to assist the longtime water-network relaxation. A series of correlations of hydrating water dynamics and coupled fluctuations with local protein's chemical and structural properties were observed. These results are significant and reveal various water behaviors in the hydration layer with wide heterogeneity. We defined a solvation speed and an angular speed to quantify the water-network rigidity and local protein flexibility, respectively. We also observed that the dynamic hydration layer extends to more than 10 A. Finally, from native to molten globule states, the hydration water networks loosen up, and the protein locally becomes more flexible with larger global plasticity and partial unfolding.},

  abstract = {Four chain spin labels and a spin-labeled cholestane were used to study  the dynamic structure of plasma membrane vesicles (PMV) prepared from  RBL-2H3 mast cells at temperatures ranging from 22 degrees C to 45  degrees C. Analysis shows that the spectra from most labels consist of  two components. The abundant spectral components exhibit substantial  ordering that is intermediate between that of a liquid-ordered (Lo)  phase, and that of a liquid-crystalline (Lc) phase as represented by  model membranes. Also, rotational diffusion rates of the spin labels  are comparable to those in the Lo phase. In contrast, the ordering for  the less abundant components is much lower. These results indicate that  a Lo-like region or phase (the abundant component) and an Lc-like  region or phase (the less abundant component) coexist in the PMV. In  contrast, membranes reconstituted from extracted lipids exhibit the  more ordered phase only. This suggests that membrane-associated  proteins are important for the coexistence of Lo-like and Lc-like  regions in the plasma membrane. In addition, binding of the  myristoylated protein, ARF6 to PMV, leads to a new spectral component  for a headgroup lipid spin label that indicates the formation of plasma  membrane defects by this low molecular weight GTPase.},

  abstract = {Neutron diffraction is an effective method for investigating model and biological membranes. Yet, to obtain accurate structural information it is necessary to use deuterium labels and much time is needed to acquire experimental data as there are a large number of diffraction reflections to register. This paper offers a way to define the hydrophobic boundary position in lipid membranes with high accuracy and for this purpose it is sufficient to take into consideration three structural factors. The method is based on modeling the density of the neutron diffraction amplitude rho(x) in the direction of the bilayer plane normal by means of a strip function, but it also takes into consideration the fact that the multiplication of the strip function amplitude rho i by the step width zi-zi-1 makes the sum of neutron scattering amplitudes of the atoms included in the step region. On the basis of the analysis of a large number of experimental data for different membranes, the effectiveness of this method in the determination of the position of hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundary is demonstrated, including the case of various rho(x) modifications in the region of polar heads and also the different phase states of membranes. However, it is shown in the present paper that the strip function model is not an adequate instrument for the determination of other structural parameters of membranes.},

  abstract  = {The thermodynamic parameters of liquid water are derived by means of a statistical thermodynamic treatment, based on the ``flickering cluster'' model proposed by Frank and Wen. Various models proposed for the structure of liquid water are reviewed, and the advantages of the Frank—Wen model are pointed out. The hydrogen-bonded ice-like clusters of H2O molecules in equilibrium with non‐hydrogen‐bonded liquid are described quantitatively in terms of the molecular species participating indifferent numbers of hydrogen bonds in the clusters. Equations expressing the mole fractions of the various species in terms of the average cluster size are derived. The partition function derived for the description of liquid water is based on a distribution of the H2O molecules over five energy levels, corresponding to four, three, two, one, and no hydrogen bonds per molecule. The most probable values of the average cluster size, the mole fraction of non‐hydrogen‐bonded water, and the thermodynamic parameters are obtained from the partition function. The energy of the hydrogen bond and the molecular ``free volume'' of the unbonded molecules are introduced as adjustable parameters; they are shown to have physically reasonable magnitudes. The average cluster size ranges from 91 to 25 H2O molecules over the temperature range from 0° to 70°C, with the mole fraction of non-hydrogen‐bonded molecules increasing from 0.24 to 0.39 over the same range of temperature. The calculated values of the free energy,enthalpy, and entropy of liquid water in this temperature range agree with experimental data to within an error of less than 3{\%}. The calculated temperature dependence of cv is too large. The calculated results agree well with the radial distribution curve derived from x‐ray diffraction data. The compressibility and the thermal expansion are considered in terms of two contributing forms in the liquid: the hydrogen‐bonded clusters and the more closely packed molecules. The P—V—T data derived for the close‐packed species from the model and from experimental data are shown to have physically reasonable magnitudes. Several other properties are discussed qualitatively on the basis of the model. The model can also be extended to provide an explanation of the properties of aqueous solutions of nonpolar substances.},

  abstract = {Several models for interactions between trifluoroethanol (TFE) and peptides and proteins have recently been proposed, but none have been able to rationalize the puzzling observations that on the one hand TFE can stabilize some hydrophobic interactions in secondary structures, but on the other can also melt the hydrophobic cores of globular proteins. The former is illustrated in this paper by the effect of TFE on a short elastin peptide, GVG(VPGVG)(3), which forms type II beta-turns stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between two intra-turn valine side chains. This folding, driven by increasing the entropy of bulk water, is stimulated in TFE-water mixtures and/or by raising the temperature. To explain these apparently contradictory observations, we propose a model in which TFE clusters locally assist the folding of secondary structures by first breaking down interfacial water molecules on the peptide and then providing a solvent matrix for further side chain--side chain interactions. This model also provides an explanation for TFE-induced transitions between secondary structures, in which the TFE clusters may redirect non-local to local interactions.},

abstract = {D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) is a membrane-bound, lipid-requiring enzyme which has a reactive sulfhydryl in the vicinity of the active center. The spin-probe-spin-label technique has been used to estimate the distance of separation of the reactive sulfhydryl of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from the bilayer surface. The reactive sulfhydryl of the enzyme was derivatized with the maleimide spin-label reagent 4-maleimido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy in the presence of the cofactor NAD+. The derivatized enzyme, inserted (inlaid orientation) into phospholipid vesicles, was titrated with spin probes, either Mn2+ or Gd3+, until the spin-label EPR spectrum was reduced in amplitude to its residual (limiting) value. From this limiting amplitude, the dipolar interaction coefficient was obtained, which is related to the reciprocal of the distance to the sixth power. The radial distances of closest approach of the paramagnetic Mn2+ and Gd3+ ions to the spin-label nitroxide on the enzyme were found to be 18 and 16 A, respectively. These calculated distances were in accord with those determined by comparison with a phosphatidylcholine calibration system having 2,2-dimethyloxazolidinyl-1-oxy spin-labels located at selected positions along the sn-2 fatty acyl chain. Since the distal nitroxide moiety of the maleimide spin-label (17 A from the bilayer surface) is 8 A from the sulfhydryl addition site, the two limiting distances of immersion of the reactive sulfhydryl within the bilayer are 9 and 25 A. The shorter distance is considered more compatible with facile access of the coenzyme to the active site of the enzyme.},

One of these cofactors, called "Z," transfers electrons from the site of water oxidation to the reaction center of photosystem II. The other species, "D," has an uncertain function but gives rise to the stable EPR signal known as signal II. Z+. and D+. have identical EPR spectra and are generally assumed to arise from species with the same chemical structure. Results from a variety of experiments have suggested that Z and D are plastoquinones or plastoquinone derivatives. In general, however, the evidence to support this assignment is indirect. To address this situation, we have developed more direct methods to assign the structure of the Z+./D+. radicals. By selective in vivo deuteration of the methyl groups of plastoquinone in cyanobacteria, we show that hyperfine couplings from the methyl protons cannot be responsible for the partially resolved structure seen in the D+. EPR spectrum. That is, we verify by extraction and mass spectrometry that quinones are labeled in algae fed deuterated methionine, but no change is observed in the line shape of signal II. Considering the spectral properties of the D+. radical, a tyrosine origin is a reasonable alternative. In a second series of experiments, we have found that deuteration of tyrosine does indeed narrow the D+. signal. Extraction and mass spectral analysis of the quinones in these cultures show that they are not labeled by tyrosine. These results eliminate a plastoquinone origin for D+.; we conclude instead that D+., and most likely Z+., are tyrosine radicals.},

Eight T4 lysozyme (T4L) mutants, doubly labeled with methanethiosulfonate spin-label (MTSSL), have been studied using DQC-ESR at 9 and 17 GHz. The distances span the range from 20 A for the 65/76 mutant to 47 A for the 61/135 mutant. The high quality of the dipolar spectra also allows the determination of the distance distributions, the width of which can be used to set upper and lower bounds in future computational strategy. It is also demonstrated that the shape of these distributions can reveal the presence of multiple conformations of the spin-label, an issue of critical relevance to the structural interpretation of the distances. The distances and distributions found in this study are readily rationalized in terms of the known crystal structure, the characteristic conformers of the nitroxide side chains, and molecular modeling. This study sets the stage for the use of DQC-ESR for determining the tertiary structure of large proteins with just a small number of long-distance constraints.},

This is shown in detail for random noise with an exponential‐cosine autocorrelation function. In the case of random noise with a pure exponential autocorrelation function, the deviation from the proportionality to the square root of the number of scans does not exceed a factor √2. If the frequency dependence of the power spectrum of the noise is given by |f|−$\lambda$, 0≤$\lambda$≤1, then the proportionality to the square root of the number of scans holds exactly. A peak in the noise power spectrum at a multiple of the repetition frequency of the scanning does affect the time averaging only if its width is smaller than the repetition frequency.},

  abstract      = {Recently a triarylmethyl-based (TAM) radical has been developed for research in biological and other aqueous systems, and in low magnetic fields, 10 mT or less, large H-1 dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancements have been reported. In this paper the DNP properties of this radical have been investigated in a considerably larger field of 1.4 T, corresponding to proton and electron Larmor frequencies of 60 MHz and 40 GHz, respectively. To avoid excessive microwave heating of the sample, an existing DNP NMR probe was modified with a screening coil, wound around the sample capillary and with its axis perpendicular to the electric component of the microwave field. It was found that with this probe the temperature increase in the sample after 4 s of microwave irradiation with an incident power of 10 W was only 16 degrees C. For the investigations, 10 mM of the TAM radical was dissolved in deionized, but not degassed, water and put into a l-mm i.d. and 6-mm long capillary tube. At 26 degrees C the following results were obtained: (I) The relaxivity of the radical is 0.07 (mMs)(-1), in accordance with the value extrapolated from low-field results; (II) The leakage factor is 0.63, the saturation factor at maximum power is 0.85, and the coupling factor is -0.0187. It is shown that these results agree very well with an analysis where the electron-dipolar interactions are the dominant DNP mechanism, and where the relaxation transitions resulting from these interactions are governed by translational diffusion of the water molecules. Finally, the possibilities of combining DNP with magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) are discussed. It is shown that at 26 degrees C the overall DNP-enhanced proton polarization should become maximal in an external field of 0.3 T and become comparable to the thermal equilibrium polarization in a field of 30 T, considerably larger than the largest high-resolution magnet available to date. It is concluded that DNP MRM in this field, which corresponds to a standard microwave frequency of 9 GHz, has the potential to significantly increase the sensitivity in NMR and MRI experiments of small aqueous samples doped with the TAM radical.

  abstract  = {The paramagnetic contributions to water-proton-spin-lattice relaxation rate constants in protein systems spin-labeled with nitroxide radicals were re-examined. As noted by others, the strength of the dipolar coupling between water protons and the protein-bound nitroxide radical often appears to be larger than physically reasonable when the relaxation is assumed to be controlled by 3-dimensional diffusive processes in the vicinity of the spin label. We examine the effects of the surface in biasing the diffusive exploration of the radical region and derive a relaxation model that incorporates 2-dimensional dynamics at the interfacial layer. However, we find that the local 2-dimensional dynamics changes the shape of the relaxation dispersion profile but does not necessarily reproduce the low-field relaxation efficiency found by experiment. We examine the contributions of long-range dipolar couplings between the paramagnetic center and protein-bound-water molecules and find that the contributions from these several long range couplings may be competitive with translational contributions because the correlation time for global rotation of the protein is approximately 1000 times longer than that for the diffusive motion of water at the interfacial region. As a result the electron-proton dipolar coupling to rare protein-bound-water-molecule protons may be significant for protein systems that accommodate long-lived-water molecules. Although the estimate of local diffusion coefficients is not seriously compromised because it derives from the Larmor frequency dependence, these several contributions confound efforts to fit relaxation data quantitatively with unique models.},

Characteristic length scales include the Debye length, the Van der Waals radius, the action distance of hydrogen bonding, the slip length, and macromolecular dimensions. On the basis of the characteristic lengths and related nanofluidic phenomena, a nanofluidic toolbox will be assembled. Nanofluidic phenomena that affect biomolecule behavior within such devices can include ion depletion and enrichment, modified velocity and mobility, permselectivity, steric hindrance, entropy, adsorption, and hydrodynamic interaction. The complex interactions and coupled physics of such phenomena allow for many applications, including biomolecule separation, concentration, reaction/hybridization, sequencing (in the case of DNA) and detection. Examples of devices for such applications will be presented, followed by a discussion of near-term challenges and future thoughts for the field.},

  abstract      = {Recent evidence suggests that proteins at equilibrium can exist in a manifold of conformational substates, and that these substates play important roles in protein function. Therefore, there is great interest in identifying regions in proteins that are in conformational exchange. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin-labeled proteins containing the nitroxide side chain (R1) often consist of two (or more) components that may arise from slow exchange between conformational substates (lifetimes {\textgreater} 100 ns). However, crystal structures of proteins containing R1 have shown that multicomponent spectra can also arise from equilibria between rotamers of the side chain itself. In this report, it is shown that these scenarios can be distinguished by the response of the system to solvent perturbation with stabilizing osmolytes such as sucrose. Thus, site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) emerges as a new tool to explore slow conformational exchange in proteins of arbitrary size, including membrane proteins in a native-like environment. Moreover, equilibrium between substates with even modest differences in conformation is revealed, and the simplicity of the method makes it suitable for facile screening of multiple proteins. Together with previously developed strategies for monitoring picosecond to millisecond backbone dynamics, the results presented here expand the timescale over which SDSL can be used to explore protein flexibility.},

  abstract  = {Proton-exchange membranes (PEM) display unique ion-selective transport that has enabled a breakthrough in high-performance proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Elemental understanding of the morphology and proton transport mechanisms of the commercially available Nafion{\textregistered} has promoted a majority of researchers to tune proton conductive channels (PCCs). Specifically, knowledge of the morphology-property relationship gained from statistical and segmented copolymer PEMs has highlighted the importance of the alignment of PCCs. Furthermore, increasing efforts in fabricating and aligning artificial PCCs in field-aligned copolymer PEMs, nanofiber composite PEMs and mesoporous PEMs have set new paradigms for improvement of membrane performances. This perspective profiles the recent development of the channels, from the self-assembled to the artificial, with a particular emphasis on their formation and alignment. It concludes with an outlook on benefits of highly aligned PCCs for fuel cell operation, and gives further direction to develop new PEMs from a practical point of view.},

  abstract = {Undersampling k-space is an effective way to decrease acquisition time for MRI. However, aliasing artifacts introduced by undersampling may blur the edges of magnetic resonance images, which often contain important information for clinical diagnosis. Moreover, k-space data is often contaminated by the noise signals of unknown intensity. To better preserve the edge features while suppressing the aliasing artifacts and noises, we present a new wavelet-based algorithm for undersampled MRI reconstruction. The algorithm solves the image reconstruction as a standard optimization problem including a ℓ(2) data fidelity term and ℓ(1) sparsity regularization term. Rather than manually setting the regularization parameter for the ℓ(1) term, which is directly related to the threshold, an automatic estimated threshold adaptive to noise intensity is introduced in our proposed algorithm. In addition, a prior matrix based on edge correlation in wavelet domain is incorporated into the regularization term. Compared with nonlinear conjugate gradient descent algorithm, iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm, fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm and the iterative thresholding algorithm using exponentially decreasing threshold, the proposed algorithm yields reconstructions with better edge recovery and noise suppression.},

(ESR) is a spectroscopic method that addresses electrons in paramagnetic materials directly through their spin properties. ESR has many applications, ranging from semiconductor characterization to structural biology and even quantum computing. Although it is very powerful and informative, ESR traditionally suffers from low sensitivity, requiring many millions of spins to get a measureable signal with commercial systems using the Faraday induction-detection principle. In view of this disadvantage, significant efforts were made recently to develop alternative detection schemes based, for example, on force, optical, or electrical detection of spins, all of which can reach single electron spin sensitivity. This sensitivity, however, comes at the price of limited applicability and usefulness with regard to real scientific and technological issues facing modern ESR which are currently dealt with conventional induction-detection ESR on a daily basis. Here, we present the most sensitive experimental induction-detection
ESR setup and results ever recorded that can detect the signal from just a few tens of spins. They were achieved thanks to the development of an ultra-miniature micrometer-sized microwave
resonator that was operated at ∼34 GHz at cryogenic temperatures in conjunction with a unique cryogenically cooled low noise amplifier. The test sample used was isotopically enriched phosphorus-doped silicon, which is of significant relevance to spin-based quantum computing. The sensitivity was experimentally verified with the aid of a unique high-resolution ESR
imaging approach. These results represent a paradigm shift with respect to the capabilities and possible applications of induction-detection-based ESR
spectroscopy and imaging.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been widely used as a powerful tool to determine the 3D structures of proteins in vivo. However, the post-spectra processing stage of NMR structure determination usually involves a tremendous amount of time and expert knowledge, which includes peak picking, chemical shift assignment and structure calculation steps. Detecting accurate peaks from the NMR spectra is a prerequisite for all following steps, and thus remains a key problem in automatic NMR structure determination.

RESULTS: We introduce WaVPeak, a fully automatic peak detection method. WaVPeak first smoothes the given NMR spectrum by wavelets. The peaks are then identified as the local maxima. The false positive peaks are filtered out efficiently by considering the volume of the peaks. WaVPeak has two major advantages over the state-of-the-art peak-picking methods. First, through wavelet-based smoothing, WaVPeak does not eliminate any data point in the spectra. Therefore, WaVPeak is able to detect weak peaks that are embedded in the noise level. NMR spectroscopists need the most help isolating these weak peaks. Second, WaVPeak estimates the volume of the peaks to filter the false positives. This is more reliable than intensity-based filters that are widely used in existing methods. We evaluate the performance of WaVPeak on the benchmark set proposed by PICKY (Alipanahi et al., 2009), one of the most accurate methods in the literature. The dataset comprises 32 2D and 3D spectra from eight different proteins. Experimental results demonstrate that WaVPeak achieves an average of 96{\%}, 91{\%}, 88{\%}, 76{\%} and 85{\%} recall on (15)N-HSQC, HNCO, HNCA, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH, respectively. When the same number of peaks are considered, WaVPeak significantly outperforms PICKY.

AVAILABILITY: WaVPeak is an open source program. The source code and two test spectra of WaVPeak are available at http://faculty.kaust.edu.sa/sites/xingao/Pages/Publications.aspx. The online server is under construction.

Specifically, both a {\textgreater}10-fold increase in bulk viscosity and the restriction of diffusion by confinement on a multiple nm length-scale change the local translational diffusion coefficient of the surface water surrounding the lipid bilayer by {\textless}2.5-fold. By contrast, previous ODNP studies have shown that changes to the biomacromolecular surface induced by folding, binding, or aggregation can cause local hydration dynamics to vary by factors of up to 30. We suggest that the surface topology and chemistry at the ≤1.5 nm scale, rather than the characteristics of the solvent, nearly exclusively determine the macromolecule's surface hydration dynamics.},

The magnetic relaxation dispersion profile (MRD) reports the spectral density function appropriate to the end-to-end correlation function for the doubly labeled molecule. After extrapolation to zero concentration to eliminate the intermolecular relaxation contribution to relaxation, the resulting intramolecular MRD profile was compared with several model approaches. The rotational model for the spectral density functions as included in the Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan equations does not describe the data well. The earlier model of Freed for nuclear spin relaxation induced by a freely diffusing paramagnetic co-solute is not rigorous for this case because the paramagnet is tethered to the observed nuclear spin and only a restricted space in the immediate vicinity of the nuclear spin is accessible for pseudo-translational diffusion of one end of the molecule with respect to the other. A generalization of the Torrey model for magnetic relaxation by translational diffusion developed by Nevzorov and Freed, which includes the effect of restrictions imposed by the finite length of the chain, describes the experiment within experimental errors. A simple modification of the Hwang-Freed model that does not specifically include the dynamical effects of the finite tether also provides a good approximation to the data when the tether chain is sufficiently long.},

We formally introduce three regression models including a Rician regression model and two associated normal models to characterize stochastic noise in various magnetic resonance imaging modalities, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and functional MRI (fMRI). Estimation algorithms are introduced to maximize the likelihood function of the three regression models. We also develop a diagnostic procedure for systematically exploring MR images to identify noise components other than simple stochastic noise, and to detect discrepancies between the fitted regression models and MRI data. The diagnostic procedure includes goodness-of-fit statistics, measures of influence, and tools for graphical display. The goodness-of-fit statistics can assess the key assumptions of the three regression models, whereas measures of influence can isolate outliers caused by certain noise components, including motion artifacts. The tools for graphical display permit graphical visualization of the values for the goodness-of-fit statistic and influence measures. Finally, we conduct simulation studies to evaluate performance of these methods, and we analyze a real dataset to illustrate how our diagnostic procedure localizes subtle image artifacts by detecting intravoxel variability that is not captured by the regression models.},

  abstract = {We have performed calculations, verified by experiment, to explain why the sensitivity of biological EPR can be dramatically increased by dividing the aqueous sample into separate compartments. In biological EPR, the major factor affecting sensitivity is the number of spins in the sample. For an aqueous sample at ambient temperature, this is limited by the requirement for a small volume, due to strong non-resonant absorption of microwaves by water. However, recent empirical studies have shown that this volume limitation can be greatly relieved by dividing the aqueous sample into separate volumes, which allows much more aqueous sample to be loaded into a resonant cavity without significant degradation of the cavity quality factor. Calculations, based on the Bruggeman mixing rule, show quantitatively that the composite aqueous sample has a permittivity much less than that of bulk water, depending on the aqueous volume fraction f. Analysis for X-band EPR spectroscopy shows that the optimal volume fraction of an aqueous composite sample, producing maximum sensitivity, is f=0.15, increasing the sensitivity by a factor of 8.7, compared with an aqueous sample in a single tube.},

abstract = {The Gly-His-Lys (GHK) peptide and the Asp-Ala-His-Lys (DAHK) sequences are naturally occurring high-affinity copper(II) chelators found in the blood plasma and are hence of biological interest. A structural study of the copper complexes of these peptides was conducted in the solid state and in solution by determining their X-ray structures, and by using a large range of spectroscopies, including EPR and HYSCORE (hyperfine sub-level correlation), X-ray absorption and (1) H and (13) C NMR spectroscopy. The results indicate that the structures of [Cu(II) (DAHK)] in the solid state and in solution are similar and confirm the equatorial coordination sphere of NH(2) , two amidyl N and one imidazole N. Additionally, a water molecule is bound apically to Cu(II) as revealed by the X-ray structure. As reported previously in the literature, [Cu(II) (GHK)], which exhibits a dimeric structure in the solid state, forms a monomeric complex in solution with three nitrogen ligands: NH(2) , amidyl and imidazole. The fourth equatorial site is occupied by a labile oxygen atom from a carboxylate ligand in the solid state. We probe that fourth position and study ternary complexes of [Cu(II) (GHK)] with glycine or histidine. The Cu(II) exchange reaction between different DAHK peptides is very slow, in contrast to [Cu(II) (GHK)], in which the fast exchange was attributed to the presence of a [Cu(II) (GHK)(2) ] complex. The redox properties of [Cu(II) (GHK)] and [Cu(II) (DAHK)] were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and by measuring the ascorbate oxidation in the presence of molecular oxygen. The measurements indicate that both Cu(II) complexes are inert under moderate redox potentials. In contrast to [Cu(II) (DAHK)], [Cu(II) (GHK)] could be reduced to Cu(I) around -0.62 V (versus AgCl/Ag) with subsequent release of the Cu ion. These complete analyses of structure and redox activity of those complexes gave new insights with biological impact and can serve as models for other more complicated Cu(II) -peptide interactions.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in portable, permanent magnet-based spectrometers is primarily limited to nuclei with higher gyromagnetic ratio, {\$}\gamma{\$}, such as 1H, 19F, and 31P due to the limited field strength achievable in these systems. Overhauser effect dynamic nuclear polarization (O-DNP), which transfers polarization from an unpaired electron to a nucleus by saturating an electron paramagnetic resonance transition with an oscillating radio frequency magnetic field, B1e, can increase the polarization of low {\$}\gamma{\$} nuclei by hundreds or even thousands, enabling detection in a portable system. We have investigated the potential for O-DNP to enhance signals using (4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO hereafter) as a source of unpaired electrons in a homebuilt ultra-low field (ULF) O-DNP-NMR spectrometer. We have found, in general, that larger concentrations of TEMPO are required for effective O-DNP with low {\$}\gamma{\$} nuclei, which has a number of important effects. Spin exchange effects cause the EPR lines to overlap and ultimately merge at high concentrations of TEMPO, fundamentally increasing the maximum possible enhancement, while the electron$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}electron dipolar interaction reduces both longitudinal and transverse relaxation times for the electrons, dramatically increasing the required B1e strength. The relationship between TEMPO concentration, B1e magnitude and O-DNP enhancement is quantified, and strategies for achieving these fields are discussed.},

  abstract = {Alpha-synuclein (alphaS) is linked to Parkinson disease through its deposition in an amyloid fibril form within Lewy Body deposits, and by the existence of three alphaS point mutations that lead to early onset autosomal dominant Parkinsonism. The normal function of alphaS is thought to be linked to the ability of the protein to bind to the surface of synaptic vesicles. Upon binding to vesicles, alphaS undergoes a structural reorganization from a dynamic and disordered ensemble to a conformation consisting of a long extended helix. In the presence of small spheroidal detergent micelles, however, this extended helix conformation can convert into a broken helix state, in which a region near the middle of the helix unwinds to form a linker between the two resulting separated helices. Membrane-bound conformations of alphaS likely mediate the function of the protein, but may also play a role in the aggregation and toxicity of the protein. Here we have undertaken a study of the effects of the three known PD-linked mutations on the detergent- and membrane-bound conformations of alphaS, as well as factors that govern the transition of the protein between the extended helix and broken helix states. Using pulsed dipolar ESR measurements of distances up to 8.7 nm, we show that all three PD-linked alphaS mutants retain the ability to transition from the broken helix to the extended helix conformation. In addition, we find that the ratio of protein to detergent, rather than just the absolute detergent concentration, determines whether the protein adopts the broken or extended helix conformation.},

The hybrid materials are obtained by a solvent-casting procedure and include between 0 and 10wt.{\%} of nanofiller. The resulting systems are extensively characterized by Thermogravimetry (TG), Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), showing that the hybrid materials are stable up to 240°C and that their overall thermal and mechanical properties are affected both by the polar groups on the surface of the silica “cores” and by the fluoroalkyl surface functionalities of the nanofiller. The electric properties of the hybrid materials are investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). It is shown that proton conductivity of the materials is not compromised by the lower water uptake arising from the hydrophobic character of the nanofiller. With respect to a pristine Nafion recast membrane, the hybrid material characterized by 5wt.{\%} of nanofiller, [Nafion/(Si80F)0.7], shows the highest conductivity in all the investigated temperature range (5≤T≤155°C). Indeed, [Nafion/(Si80F)0.7] features the lowest water uptake and presents a conductivity of 0.083Scm−1 at 135°C. This result is consistent with the good performance of the membrane in single fuel cell tests.},

  abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) results in a substantial nuclear polarization enhancement through a transfer of the magnetization from electrons to nuclei. Recent years have seen considerable progress in the development of DNP experiments directed towards enhancing sensitivity in biological nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This review covers the applications, hardware, polarizing agents, and theoretical descriptions that were developed at the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology for high-field DNP experiments. In frozen dielectrics, the enhanced nuclear polarization developed in the vicinity of the polarizing agent can be efficiently dispersed to the bulk of the sample via (1)H spin diffusion. This strategy has been proven effective in polarizing biologically interesting systems, such as nanocrystalline peptides and membrane proteins, without leading to paramagnetic broadening of the NMR signals. Gyrotrons have been used as a source of high-power (5-10 W) microwaves up to 460 GHz as required for the DNP experiments. Other hardware has also been developed allowing in situ microwave irradiation integrated with cryogenic magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR. Advances in the quantum mechanical treatment are successful in describing the mechanism by which new biradical polarizing agents yield larger enhancements at higher magnetic fields. Finally, pulsed methods and solution experiments should play a prominent role in the future of DNP.},

It was shown that all these substances stabilize the protein structure against thermal denaturation and (except for trimethylamine N-oxide for which interaction measurements could not be made) are strongly excluded from the protein domain, rendering unlikely their direct binding to proteins. On the other hand, valine, not known as an osmolyte, had no stabilizing effect, although it induced a large protein-preferential hydration. A possible explanation is given for the use of these substances as osmotic-pressure-regulating agents in organisms living under high osmotic pressure.},

But it is difficult to differentiate molecules with similar diffusion coefficients in presence of overlapped spectra. Its performance is susceptible to the number of chemical components, and usually gets worse when the number of components increases. Here, to alleviate the problem, numerical simultaneous inversion of Laplace transform (SILT) of many related variables is proposed for reconstructing DOSY spectrum (SILT-DOSY). The advantage of the proposed method in comparison to other methods is that it is capable of estimating the number of analytes more accurately and deriving corresponding component spectra, which in turn leads to the more reliable identification of the components.},

The disease-specific amyloid fibrils comprise primarily a single protein, amyloid beta, in Alzheimer's disease, and the prion protein in scrapie. These proteins can be induced to form aggregates in vitro that are indistinguishable from brain-derived fibrils. Consequently, much effort has been invested in the development of in vitro model systems to study the details of the aggregation processes and the effects of endogenous molecules that have been implicated in disease. Selected studies of this type are reviewed herein. A simple mechanistic model has emerged for both processes that involves a nucleation-dependent polymerization. This mechanism dictates that aggregation is dependent on protein concentration and time. Furthermore, amyloid formation can be seeded by a preformed fibril. The physiological consequences of this mechanism are discussed.},

However, such use leads to a nonlinear phase of the transverse magnetization, which is why FM pulses like the hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse are not commonly used for multislice spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, a general theory and methods are described for conventional spin-echo imaging using a pi HS pulse for refocusing. Phase profiles produced by the HS pulse are analytically described. The analysis is extended to yield the specific relationships between pulse parameters and gradients, which must be satisfied to compensate the nonlinear phase variation produced with a spin-echo sequence composed of pi/2 and pi HS pulses (the pi/2 HS - pi HS sequence). The latter offers advantages for multislice spin-echo MRI, including excellent slice-selection and partial compensation for RF inhomogeneity. Furthermore, it can be implemented with a shorter echo time and lower power deposition than a previously described method using a pair of pi HS pulses.},

This significantly reduces the effect of nuclear spin-diffusion on the electron-spin phase relaxation, thereby enabling longer dipolar evolution times that are required to measure longer distances. Using spin-labeled T4 lysozyme at a concentration less than 50 $\mu$M, as an example, we show that the evolution time increases by a factor of 1.8 in protonated solution and 1.4 in deuterated solution to 8 and 12 $\mu$s, respectively, with the potential to increase them further. This enables a significant increase in the measurable distances, improved distance resolution, or both.},

Here we use the ultrafast optical Kerr effect to study the H-bond structure and dynamics of aqueous solutions of proteins. Measurements are made for three proteins as a function of concentration. We find that the water dynamics in the first solvation layer of the proteins are slowed by up to a factor of 8 in comparison to those in bulk water. The most marked slowdown was observed for the most hydrophilic protein studied, bovine serum albumin, whereas the most hydrophobic protein, trypsin, had a slightly smaller effect.

  abstract = {In a variety of bacteria, the phosphotransferase protein IIA(Glc) plays a key regulatory role in catabolite repression in addition to its role in the vectorial phosphorylation of glucose catalyzed by the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). The lactose permease (LacY) of Escherichia coli catalyzes stoichiometric symport of a galactoside with an H(+), using a mechanism in which sugar- and H(+)-binding sites become alternatively accessible to either side of the membrane. Both the expression (via regulation of cAMP levels) and the activity of LacY are subject to regulation by IIA(Glc) (inducer exclusion). Here we report the thermodynamic features of the IIA(Glc)-LacY interaction as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The studies show that IIA(Glc) binds to LacY with a Kd of about 5 $\mu$M and a stoichiometry of unity and that binding is driven by solvation entropy and opposed by enthalpy. Upon IIA(Glc) binding, the conformational entropy of LacY is restrained, which leads to a significant decrease in sugar affinity. By suppressing conformational dynamics, IIA(Glc) blocks inducer entry into cells and favors constitutive glucose uptake and utilization. Furthermore, the studies support the notion that sugar binding involves an induced-fit mechanism that is inhibited by IIA(Glc) binding. The precise mechanism of the inhibition of LacY by IIA(Glc) elucidated by ITC differs from the inhibition of melibiose permease (MelB), supporting the idea that permeases can differ in their thermodynamic response to binding IIA(Glc).},

The OEC is buried within photosystem II (PSII), a multisubunit integral membrane protein complex, and water must find its way to the Mn(4)Ca cluster by moving through protein. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the energetic barriers for water permeation though PSII extrinsic proteins. Potentials of mean force (PMFs) for water were derived by using the technique of multiple steered molecular dynamics (MSMD). Calculation of free energy profiles for water permeation allowed us to characterize previously identified water channels, and discover new pathways for water movement toward the Mn(4)Ca cluster. Our results identify the main constriction sites in these pathways which may serve as selectivity filters that restrict both the access of solutes detrimental to the water oxidation reaction and loss of Ca(2+) and Cl(-) from the active site.},

  abstract = {The fast Fourier transformation has been the gold standard for transforming data from time to frequency domain in many spectroscopic methods, including NMR. While reliable, it has as a drawback that it requires a grid of uniformly sampled data points. This needs very long measuring times for sampling in multidimensional experiments in all indirect dimensions uniformly and even does not allow reaching optimal evolution times that would match the resolution power of modern high-field instruments. Thus, many alternative sampling and transformation schemes have been proposed. Their common challenges are the suppression of the artifacts due to the non-uniformity of the sampling schedules, the preservation of the relative signal amplitudes, and the computing time needed for spectra reconstruction. Here we present a fast implementation of the Iterative Soft Thresholding approach (istHMS) that can reconstruct high-resolution non-uniformly sampled NMR data up to four dimensions within a few hours and make routine reconstruction of high-resolution NUS 3D and 4D spectra convenient. We include a graphical user interface for generating sampling schedules with the Poisson-Gap method and an estimation of optimal evolution times based on molecular properties. The performance of the approach is demonstrated with the reconstruction of non-uniformly sampled medium and high-resolution 3D and 4D protein spectra acquired with sampling densities as low as 0.8{\%}. The method presented here facilitates acquisition, reconstruction and use of multidimensional NMR spectra at otherwise unreachable spectral resolution in indirect dimensions.},

In some circumstances, however, proteins can self-assemble into fibrillar aggregates designated as amyloid fibrils. In vivo these processes are normally associated with severe pathological conditions but can sometimes have functional relevance. One such example is the hydrophobins, whose aggregation at air-water interfaces serves to create robust protein coats that help fungal spores to resist wetting and thus facilitate their dispersal in the air. We have performed multiscale simulations to address the molecular determinants governing the formation of functional amyloids by the class I fungal hydrophobin EAS. Extensive samplings of full-atom replica-exchange molecular dynamics and coarse-grained simulations have allowed us to identify factors that distinguish aggregation-prone from highly soluble states of EAS. As a result of unfavourable entropic terms, highly dynamical regions are shown to exert a crucial influence on the propensity of the protein to aggregate under different conditions. More generally, our findings suggest a key role that specific flexible structural elements can play to ensure the existence of soluble and functional states of proteins under physiological conditions.},

Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of biological macromolecules and their hydration water depends strongly on the chemical and three-dimensional structures of the biomolecules.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging has surfaced as a promising noninvasive imaging modality that is capable of imaging tissue oxygenation. Due to extremely short spin-spin relaxation times, electron paramagnetic resonance imaging benefits from single-point imaging and inherently suffers from limited spatial and temporal resolution, preventing localization of small hypoxic tissues and differentiation of hypoxia dynamics, making accelerated imaging a crucial issue. METHODS: In this study, methods for accelerated single-point imaging were developed by combining a bilateral k-space extrapolation technique with model-based reconstruction that benefits from dense sampling in the parameter domain (measurement of the T2 (*) decay of a free induction delay). In bilateral kspace extrapolation, more k-space samples are obtained in a sparsely sampled region by bilaterally extrapolating data from temporally neighboring k-spaces. To improve the accuracy of T2 (*) estimation, a principal component analysis-based method was implemented. RESULTS: In a computer simulation and a phantom experiment, the proposed methods showed its capability for reliable T2 (*) estimation with high acceleration (8-fold, 15-fold, and 30-fold accelerations for 61×61×61, 95×95×95, and 127×127×127 matrix, respectively). CONCLUSION: By applying bilateral k-space extrapolation and model-based reconstruction, improved scan times with higher spatial resolution can be achieved in the current single-point electron paramagnetic resonance imaging modality.},

abstract = {In this study, we exploit the excellent fouling resistance of polymer zwitterions and present electrospun nanofiber mats surface functionalized with poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (polyMPC). This zwitterionic polymer coating maximizes the accessibility of the zwitterion to effectively limit biofouling on nanofiber membranes. Two facile, scalable methods yielded a coating on cellulose nanofibers: (i) a two-step sequential deposition featuring dopamine polymerization followed by the physioadsorption of polyMPC, and (ii) a one-step codeposition of polydopamine (PDA) with polyMPC. While the sequential and codeposited nanofiber mat assemblies have an equivalent average fiber diameter, hydrophilic contact angle, surface chemistry, and stability, the topography of nanofibers prepared by codeposition were smoother. Protein and microbial antifouling performance of the zwitterion modified nanofiber mats along with two controls, cellulose (unmodified) and PDA coated nanofiber mats were evaluated by dynamic protein fouling and prolonged bacterial exposure. Following 21 days of exposure to bovine serum albumin, the sequential nanofiber mats significantly resisted protein fouling, as indicated by their 95{\%} flux recovery ratio in a water flux experiment, a 300{\%} improvement over the cellulose nanofiber mats. When challenged with two model microbes Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus for 24 h, both zwitterion modifications demonstrated superior fouling resistance by statistically reducing microbial attachment over the two controls. This study demonstrates that, by decorating the surfaces of chemically and mechanically robust cellulose nanofiber mats with polyMPC, we can generate high performance, free-standing nanofiber mats that hold potential in applications where antifouling materials are imperative, such as tissue engineering scaffolds and water purification technologies.},

We employed a home-built Alderman-Grant probe for the detection of ¹H NMR signal at 300 MHz, as such coils are well suited for higher frequency NMR detection. The Alderman-Grant coil is inductively coupled to the rest of the radiofrequency (rf) circuit, whose design allows probe components to be placed away from the sample area, and also enables easy switching of coils with different diameters and resonance frequencies. We have tested our DNP instrument on a frozen nitroxide model system consisting of 4-Amino TEMPO dissolved in a glycerol:water mixture. The largest nuclear spin polarization observed was 61 ± 2{\%} with a sample containing 20 mM 4-Amino TEMPO dissolved in deuterated glycerol (d-glycerol):D₂O:H₂O (50:40:10), amounting to record polarization measured to date at an easily amenable temperature of 4 K.},

  abstract = {A search for organizing principles underlying molecular patterning at the cell surface and its regulation over different scales is necessary. This is important for understanding how the cell builds membrane bound organelles that emanate from it and for how the cell interacts with its physical and chemical milieu. This requires a broad framework to rationalize the mass of accumulated data about the spatial localization and dynamics of its constituents, and their physical and chemical environment. Lateral heterogeneities in the organization of membrane components of a living cell appear to be a hallmark of how a cell addresses sorting and signaling functions. Here we explore two classes of mechanisms of segregation of membrane components in the plasma membrane. We suggest that viewing the membrane as a passive, thermally equilibrated system is unlikely to provide an adequate framework to understand the mechanisms of membrane component segregation in vivo. Instead the surface of living cells behaves as an active membrane composite.},

  abstract  = {Designs for a broadband chirped pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectrometer are presented. The spectrometer is capable of measuring the 7-18 GHz region of a rotational spectrum in a single data acquisition. One design uses a 4.2 Gsampless arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) to produce a 1 mus duration chirped pulse with a linear frequency sweep of 1.375 GHz. This pulse is sent through a microwave circuit to multiply the bandwidth of the pulse by a factor of 8 and upconvert it to the 7.5-18.5 GHz range. The chirped pulse is amplified by a traveling wave tube amplifier and broadcast inside the spectrometer by using a double ridge standard gain horn antenna. The broadband molecular free induction decay (FID) is received by a second horn antenna, downconverted, and digitized by a 40 Gsampless (12 GHz hardware bandwidth) digital oscilloscope. The second design uses a simplified pulse generation and FID detection scheme, employing current state-of-the-art high-speed digital electronics. In this spectrometer, a chirped pulse with 12 GHz of bandwidth is directly generated by using a 20 Gsampless AWG and upconverted in a single step with an ultrabroadband mixer. The amplified molecular emission is directly detected by using a 50 Gsampless digital oscilloscope with 18 GHz bandwidth. In both designs, fast Fourier transform of the FID produces the frequency domain rotational spectrum in the 7-18 GHz range. The performance of the CP-FTMW spectrometer is compared to a Balle-Flygare-type cavity-FTMW spectrometer. The CP-FTMW spectrometer produces an equal sensitivity spectrum with a factor of 40 reduction in measurement time and a reduction in sample consumption by a factor of 20. The CP-FTMW spectrometer also displays good intensity accuracy for both sample number density and rotational transition moment. Strategies to reduce the CP-FTMW measurement time by another factor of 90 while simultaneously reducing the sample consumption by a factor of 30 are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {We present a new methodological basis for selectively illuminating a dilute population of fluid within a porous medium. Specifically, transport in porous materials can be analyzed by now-standard nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry and NMR pulsed field gradient (PFG) diffusometry methods in combination with with the prominent NMR signal amplification tool, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). The key components of the approach introduced here are (1) to selectively place intrinsic or extrinsic paramagnetic probes at the site or local volume of interest within the sample, (2) to amplify the signal from the local solvent around the paramagnetic probes with Overhauser DNP, which is performed in situ and under ambient conditions, and (3) to observe the ODNP-enhanced solvent signal with 1D or 2D NMR relaxometry methods, thus selectively amplifying only the relaxation dynamics of the fluid that resides in or percolates through the local porous volume that contains the paramagnetic probe. Here, we demonstrate the proof of principle of this approach by selectively amplifying the NMR signal of only one solvent population, which is in contact with a paramagnetic probe and occluded from a second solvent population. An apparent one-component T 2 relaxation decay is shown to actually contain two distinct solvent populations. The approach outlined here should be universally applicable to a wide range of other 1D and 2D relaxometry and PFG diffusometry measurements, including T 1-T 2 or T 1-D correlation maps, where the occluded population containing the paramagnetic probes can be selectively amplified for its enhanced characterization.},

NIMs are designed to behave as liquids under ambient conditions in the absence of solvent and have no volatile organic content, making them useful for a number of applications. We have used nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation and pulsed-field gradient NMR to probe local and collective canopy dynamics in NIMs based on 18-nm silica NPs with a covalently bound anionic corona, neutralized by amine-terminated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers. The NMR relaxation studies show that the nanosecond-scale canopy dynamics depend on the degree of neutralization, the canopy radius of gyration, and crowding at the ionically modified NP surface. Two canopy populations are observed in the diffusion experiments, demonstrating that one fraction of the canopy is bound to the NP surface on the time scale (milliseconds) of the diffusion experime...},

These studies pave the way for the application of such long-distance paramagnetic restraints to protein structure elucidation and analysis of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions in the solid phase. Paramagnetic species also facilitate the rapid acquisition of high resolution and sensitivity multidimensional solid-state NMR spectra of biomacromolecules using condensed data collection schemes, and characterization of solvent-accessible surfaces of peptides and proteins. In this review we discuss some of the latest applications of magic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with paramagnetic probes to the structural studies of proteins in the solid state.},

The applicability range of this relation is determined: the relation is fulfilled in the case of a large difference in g-factor between the radicals involved and for the situation where the number of magnetic nuclei in the system is sufficiently large. The validity of the relation was confirmed by CIDNP experiments on radical pairs with precisely known HFCCs.

Water cluster anions that include two complete solvation shells centered on the hydrated electron were extracted from the MQC MD simulations and embedded in a roughly 18 Ax18 Ax18 A matrix of fractional point charges designed to represent the rest of the solvent. Density functional theory (DFT) with the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr functional and single-excitation configuration interaction (CIS) methods were then applied to these embedded clusters. The salient feature of these hybrid DFT(CIS)/MQC MD calculations is significant transfer (approximately 18{\%}) of the excess electron's charge density into the 2p orbitals of oxygen atoms in OH groups forming the solvation cavity. We used the results of these calculations to examine the structure of the singly occupied and the lower unoccupied molecular orbitals, the density of states, the absorption spectra in the visible and ultraviolet, the hyperfine coupling (hfcc) tensors, and the infrared (IR) and Raman spectra of these embedded water cluster anions. The calculated hfcc tensors were used to compute electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectra for the hydrated electron that compared favorably to the experimental spectra of trapped electrons in alkaline ice. The calculated vibrational spectra of the hydrated electron are consistent with the red-shifted bending and stretching frequencies observed in resonance Raman experiments. In addition to reproducing the visible/near IR absorption spectrum, the hybrid DFT model also accounts for the hydrated electron's 190-nm absorption band in the ultraviolet. Thus, our study suggests that to explain several important experimentally observed properties of the hydrated electron, many-electron effects must be accounted for: one-electron models that do not allow for mixing of the excess electron density with the frontier orbitals of the first-shell solvent molecules cannot explain the observed magnetic, vibrational, and electronic properties of this species. Despite the need for multielectron effects to explain these important properties, the ensemble-averaged radial wavefunctions and energetics of the highest occupied and three lowest unoccupied orbitals of the hydrated electrons in our hybrid model are close to the s- and p-like states obtained in one-electron models. Thus, one-electron models can provide a remarkably good approximation to the multielectron picture of the hydrated electron for many applications; indeed, the two approaches appear to be complementary.},

In contrast, our method sensitively measures nonlinearity-induced changes in the pulse spectrum. In this work we demonstrate the technique in nonlinear absorptive and dispersive samples, quantify the obtained signal, and compare the measurements with traditional Z-scans. This technique is capable of measuring these nonlinearities in highly scattering samples.},

Here, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) is used to study the ultrafast hydration and protein dynamics sensed by a metal carbonyl vibrational probe covalently attached to the surface of hen egg white lysozyme dissolved in D(2)O/glycerol solutions. Surface labeling provides direct access to the dynamics at the protein-water interface, where both the hydration and the protein dynamics can be observed simultaneously through the vibrational probe's frequency-frequency correlation function. In pure D(2)O, the correlation function shows a fast initial 3 ps decay corresponding to fluctuations of the hydration water, followed by a significant static offset attributed to fluctuations of the protein that are not sampled within the {\textless}20 ps experimental window. Adding glycerol increases the bulk solvent viscosity while leaving the protein structurally intact and hydrated. The hydration dynamics exhibit a greater than 3-fold slowdown between 0 and 80{\%} glycerol (v/v), and the contribution from the protein's dynamics is found to slow in a nearly identical fashion. In addition, the magnitude of the dynamic slowdown associated with hydrophobic hydration is directly measured and shows quantitative agreement with predictions from molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Established pulse EPR approaches to the measurement of small dipole-dipole couplings between electron spins rely on constant-time echo experiments to separate relaxational contributions from dipolar time evolution. This requires a compromise between sensitivity and resolution to be made prior to the measurement, so that optimum data are only obtained if the magnitude of the dipole-dipole coupling is known beforehand to a good approximation. Moreover, the whole dipolar evolution function is measured with relatively low sensitivity. These problems are overcome by a variable-time experiment that achieves suppression of the relaxation contribution by reference deconvolution. Theoretical and experimental results show that this approach leads to significant sensitivity improvements for typical systems and experimental conditions. Further sensitivity improvements or, equivalently, an extension of the accessible distance range can be obtained by matrix deuteration or digital long-pass filtering of the time-domain data. Advantages and limitations of the new variable-time experiment are discussed by comparing it to the established analogous constant-time experiment for measurements of end-to-end distances of 5 and 7.5 nm on rod-like shape-persistent biradicals and for the measurement of a broadly distributed transmembrane distance in a doubly spin-labeled mutant of plant light harvesting complex II.},

The bulk of the C-ring forms from many copies of the proteins FliG, FliM, and FliN, which together constitute the switch complex. To help resolve outstanding issues regarding C-ring architecture, we have investigated interactions between FliM and FliG from Thermotoga maritima with X-ray crystallography and pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy (PDS). A new crystal structure of an 11-unit FliG:FliM complex produces a large arc with a curvature consistent with the dimensions of the C-ring. Previously determined structures along with this newstructure provided a basis to testswitchcomplex assemblymodels.PDScombined withmutational studies and targeted cross-linking reveal that FliM and FliG interact through their middle domains to form both parallel and antiparallel arrangements in solution. Residue substitutions at predicted interfaces disrupt higher- order complexes that are primarily mediated by contacts between the C-terminal domain of FliG and the middle domain of a neighboring FliG molecule. Spin separations among multi-labeled components fit a self-consistent model that agreewell with electron microscopy images of the C-ring. An activated form of the response regulator CheY destabilizes the parallel arrangement of FliM molecules to perturb FliG alignment in a process that may reflect the onset of rotation switching. These data suggest a model of C-ring assembly in which intermolecular contacts among FliG domains provide a template for FliM assembly and cooperative transitions.},

The synthesis and characterization by SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometry of one of the high-spin diradicals, in which nitroxides are conformationally constrained to be coplanar with the m-phenylene unit, is reported. The interspin distances ranged from about 5-9 A, and the magnitude of the exchange interaction ranged from {\textgreater}150 to {\textgreater}0.1 K. 1/T1 and 1/Tm were measured by long-pulse saturation recovery, three-pulse inversion recovery, and two-pulse echo decay at X-band (9.5 GHz) and Q-band (35 GHz). For a diradical with interspin distance about 9 A, relaxation rates were only slightly faster than for a monoradical with analogous structure. For interspin distances of about 5-6 A, relaxation rates in glassy solvents up to 300 K increased in the order monoradical {\textless} diradical {\textless} tetraradical. Modulation of electron-electron interaction enhanced relaxation via the direct, Raman, and local mode processes. The largest differences in 1/T1 were observed below 10 K, where the direct process dominates. For the three diradicals with comparable magnitude of dipolar interaction, 1/Tm and 1/T1 were faster for the molecules with more flexible structures. Relaxation rates were faster in the less rigid low-polarity sucrose octaacetate glass than in the more rigid 4:1 toluene/chloroform or in hydrogen-bonded glycerol glasses, which highlights the impact of motion on relaxation.},

  abstract = {Protein aggregation in aqueous cellular environments is linked to diverse human diseases. Protein aggregation proceeds through a multistep process initiated by conformational transitions, called protein misfolding, of monomer species toward aggregation-prone structures. Various forms of aggregate species are generated through the association of misfolded monomers including soluble oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms and driving forces involved in the misfolding and subsequent association has been a central issue for understanding and preventing protein aggregation diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and type II diabetes. In this Account, we provide a thermodynamic perspective of the misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease through the application of fluctuating thermodynamics. This approach "dissects" the conventional thermodynamic characterization of the end states into the one of the fluctuating processes connecting them, and enables one to analyze variations in the thermodynamic functions that occur during the course of protein conformational changes. The central quantity in this approach is the solvent-averaged effective energy, f = Eu + Gsolv, comprising the protein potential energy (Eu) and the solvation free energy (Gsolv), whose time variation reflects the protein dynamics on the free energy landscape. Protein configurational entropy is quantified by the magnitude of fluctuations in f. We find that misfolding of the A$\beta$ monomer when released from a membrane environment to an aqueous phase is driven by favorable changes in protein potential energy and configurational entropy, but it is also accompanied by an unfavorable increase in solvation free energy. The subsequent dimerization of the misfolded A$\beta$ monomers occurs in two steps. The first step, where two widely separated monomers come into contact distance, is driven by water-mediated attraction, that is, by a decrease in solvation free energy, harnessing the monomer solvation free energy earned during the misfolding. The second step, where a compact dimer structure is formed, is driven by direct protein-protein interactions, but again it is accompanied by an increase in solvation free energy. The increased solvation free energy of the dimer will function as the driving force to recruit another A$\beta$ protein in the approach stage of subsequent oligomerizations. The fluctuating thermodynamics analysis of the misfolding and dimerization of the A$\beta$ protein indicates that the interaction of the protein with surrounding water plays a critical role in protein aggregation. Such a water-centric perspective is further corroborated by demonstrating that, for a large number of A$\beta$ mutants and mutants of other protein systems, the change in the experimental aggregation propensity upon mutation has a significant correlation with the protein solvation free energy change. We also find striking discrimination between the positively and negatively charged residues on the protein surface by surrounding water molecules, which is shown to play a crucial role in determining the protein aggregation propensity. We argue that the protein total charge dictates such striking behavior of the surrounding water molecules. Our results provide new insights for understanding and predicting the protein aggregation propensity, thereby offering novel design principles for producing aggregation-resistant proteins for biotherapeutics.},

Using a recently introduced algorithm, we have quantitatively simulated previously published small-angle scattering data of hydrated Nafion. The characteristic 'ionomer peak' arises from long parallel but otherwise randomly packed water channels surrounded by partially hydrophilic side branches, forming inverted-micelle cylinders. At 20 vol{\%} water, the water channels have diameters of between 1.8 and 3.5 nm, with an average of 2.4 nm. Nafion crystallites (approximately 10 vol{\%}), which form physical crosslinks that are crucial for the mechanical properties of Nafion films, are elongated and parallel to the water channels, with cross-sections of approximately (5 nm)(2). Simulations for various other models of Nafion, including Gierke's cluster and the polymer-bundle model, do not match the scattering data. The new model can explain important features of Nafion, including fast diffusion of water and protons through Nafion and its persistence at low temperatures.},

Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) by means of nitroxide spin-labels can provide valuable long-range distance information but, in practice, has limits in its application to membrane proteins because spin-labels are often incompletely reduced in highly apolar environments. Using the integral membrane protein OmpA as a model system, we introduce a method of parallel spin-labeling with paramagnetic and diamagnetic labels and show that distances in the range 15-24 Angstroms can be readily determined. The protein was labeled at 11 water-exposed and lipid-covered sites, and 320 PRE distance restraints were measured. The addition of these restraints resulted in significant improvement of the calculated backbone structure of OmpA. Structures of reasonable quality can even be calculated with PRE distance restraints only, i.e., in the absence of NOE distance restraints.},

For each pathway, amplitudes and frequencies of the signal components are computed and used to construct a spectral histogram from which the time-domain signal is obtained. For multinuclear spin systems, the nuclear subspace is factorized to accelerate the computation. The method is also applicable to high electron spin systems with significant zero-field splitting and to pulse electron-nuclear double resonance experiments.

Protein hydration--the perturbation of water structure and dynamics by the protein surface--has been a particularly rich source of controversy and confusion. Our aim here is to critically examine central concepts in the description of protein hydration, and to assess the experimental basis for the current view of protein hydration, with the focus on dynamic aspects. Recent oxygen-17 magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) experiments have shown that the vast majority of water molecules in the protein hydration layer suffer a mere twofold dynamic retardation compared with bulk water. The high mobility of hydration water ensures that all thermally activated processes at the protein-water interface, such as binding, recognition and catalysis, can proceed at high rates. The MRD-derived picture of a highly mobile hydration layer is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations, but is incompatible with results deduced from intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, dielectric relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is also inconsistent with the common view of hydration effects on protein hydrodynamics. Here, we show how these discrepancies can be resolved.},

  abstract  = {With the technique of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) signal intensity in solid-state MAS-NMR experiments can be enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude. DNP relies on the transfer of electron spin polarization from unpaired electrons to nuclear spins. For this reason, stable organic biradicals such as TOTAPOL are commonly added to samples used in DNP experiments. We investigated the effects of biradical concentration on the relaxation, enhancement, and intensity of NMR signals, employing a series of samples with various TOTAPOL concentrations and uniformly (13)C, (15)N labeled proline. A considerable decrease of the NMR relaxation times (T(1), T(2)(∗), and T(1)($\rho$)) is observed with increasing amounts of biradical due to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). For nuclei in close proximity to the radical, decreasing T(1)($\rho$) reduces cross-polarization efficiency and decreases in T(2)(∗) broaden the signal. Additionally, paramagnetic shifts of (1)H signals can cause further line broadening by impairing decoupling. On average, the combination of these paramagnetic effects (PE; relaxation enhancement, paramagnetic shifts) quenches NMR-signals from nuclei closer than 10{\AA} to the biradical centers. On the other hand, shorter T(1) times allow the repetition rate of the experiment to be increased, which can partially compensate for intensity loss. Therefore, it is desirable to optimize the radical concentration to prevent additional line broadening and to maximize the signal-to-noise observed per unit time for the signals of interest.},

The performance of such devices has improved significantly over the last decade, providing increased field homogeneity, field strength and even controlled static field gradients. For a class of these devices, the configuration of the permanent magnets provides a linear variation of the magnetic field and can be used in diffusion measurements. However, magnet design depends directly on its application and, according to the purpose, the field homogeneity may significantly be compromised. This may prevent the determination of diffusion properties of fluids based on the natural inhomogeneity of the field using known techniques. This work introduces a new approach that extends the applicability of diffusion-editing CPMG experiments to NMR devices with highly inhomogeneous magnetic fields, which do not vary linearly in space. Herein, we propose a method to determine a custom diffusion kernel based on the gradient distribution, which can be seen as a signature of each NMR device. This new diffusion kernel is then utilised in the 2D inverse Laplace transform (2D ILT) in order to determine diffusion-relaxation correlation maps of homogeneous multi-phasic fluids. The experiments were performed using NMR MObile Lateral Explore (MOLE), which is a single-sided NMR device designed to maximise the volume at the sweet spot with enhanced depth penetration.},

  abstract = {An analytical model for water and charge transport in highly acidic and highly confined systems such as proton exchange membranes of fuel cells is developed and compared to available experimental data. The model is based on observations from both experiment and multiscale simulation. The model accounts for three factors in the system including acidity, confinement, and connectivity. This model has its basis in the molecular-level mechanisms of water transport but has been coarse-grained to the extent that it can be expressed in an analytical form. The model uses the concentration of H(3)O(+) ion to characterize acidity, interfacial surface area per water molecule to characterize confinement, and percolation theory to describe connectivity. Several important results are presented. First, an integrated multiscale simulation approach including both molecular dynamics simulation and confined random walk theory is capable of quantitatively reproducing experimentally measured self-diffusivities of water in the perfluorinated sulfonic acid proton exchange membrane material, Nafion. The simulations, across a range of hydration conditions from minimally hydrated to fully saturated, have an average error for the self-diffusivity of water of 16{\%} relative to experiment. Second, accounting for three factors-acidity, confinement, and connectivity-is necessary and sufficient to understand the self-diffusivity of water in proton exchange membranes. Third, an analytical model based on percolation theory is capable of quantitatively reproducing experimentally measured self-diffusivities of both water and charge in Nafion across a full range of hydration.},

abstract = {The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase, controls cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors and is frequently deregulated in cancer. Here we report co-crystal structures of a complex of truncated mTOR and mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8) with an ATP transition state mimic and with ATP-site inhibitors. The structures reveal an intrinsically active kinase conformation, with catalytic residues and a catalytic mechanism remarkably similar to canonical protein kinases. The active site is highly recessed owing to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain and an inhibitory helix protruding from the catalytic cleft. mTOR-activating mutations map to the structural framework that holds these elements in place, indicating that the kinase is controlled by restricted access. In vitro biochemistry shows that the FRB domain acts as a gatekeeper, with its rapamycin-binding site interacting with substrates to grant them access to the restricted active site. Rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits the kinase by directly blocking substrate recruitment and by further restricting active-site access. The structures also reveal active-site residues and conformational changes that underlie inhibitor potency and specificity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thermally activated ion channels function as molecular thermometers and participate in other physiological important functions. The mechanism by which they acquire their exquisite temperature sensitivity is unknown and is currently an area of intense research. For this reason, there is a need for diverse methods to deliver controlled temperature stimuli.

NEW METHOD: We have developed a simple, inexpensive and reliable method to deliver temperature pulses to small volumes surrounding the recording area, which can be either a patch-clamp pipette containing a cell-free membrane with thermally activated channels or a whole cell attached to a pipette.

RESULTS: Here we developed a micro-heater based on resistive heating of a copper filament enclosed in a glass capillary that is capable of delivering fast and localized temperature changes. We validated the performance of the micro-heaters by analyzing the heat-induced activation of TRPV1 thermoTRP channels recorded in inside-out patches and demonstrate the use of the micro-heaters.

COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): The micro-heaters we introduce here are compact, easy to fabricate and to operate. In contrast with bulk solution heaters commercially available, our method is extremely affordable and simple to operate. To the best of our knowledge there are no other similar, commercially available heating methods.

CONCLUSIONS: The micro-heater method is simple and should provide a straightforward and rapid experimental tool to study mechanisms in thermally activated ion channels.},

  abstract      = {In a previous paper we developed a method, Filter‐Diagonalization, for extracting eigenvalues and eigenstates of a given operator at any desired energy range. In essence, the method eliminates correlation between distant eigenstates through a short‐time filter while correlations between closely lying states are eliminated by diagonalization. Here we extend Filter‐Diagonalization. When used to extract eigenvalues for a given operator H, we show that all eigenvalue information is directly extracted from a short segment of the correlation functionC(t)=($\psi$(0)‖e −iHt ‖$\psi$(0)), or alternately from a small number of residues ($\psi$(0)‖R n (H)‖$\psi$(0)), where $\psi$(0) is a random initial function and R n (H) is any desired polynomial expansion in H. The implications of this feature are twofold. First, in contrast to the previous version the wave packet needs only to be propagated once (to prepare C(t)), and eigenstates at all desired energy windows can then be extracted with negligible extra computation time (and negligible storage requirements). In a simulation presented here, accurate eigenvalues are extracted using propagation times which are only a 0.0041 fraction of the ‘‘natural'' time, i.e., the time by which the relative phase of the two closest eigenstates reaches 2$\pi$. The second and more important feature is that the method is automatically suitable for extracting eigenvalues (or normal modes) using a short‐time segment of any signal C(t) which is a sum of (unknown) Fourier components (C(t)=∑ nd ne −i$\epsilon$ nt ) regardless of its origin. In addition to its use for determining eigenvalues of known operators, the method may also be utilized to extract normal modes from classical‐dynamics simulations, eigenstates from real‐time Quantum Monte‐Carlo studies, frequencies from experimental optical or electrical signals, or be utilized in any other circumstance where a correlation function or general signal is only known for short times (or expensive to generate at long times).},

The resulting time series are usually evaluated in terms of time averages. Often anomalous diffusion is connected with non-ergodic behaviour. In such cases the time averages remain random variables and hence irreproducible. Here we present a detailed analysis of the time averaged mean squared displacement for systems governed by anomalous diffusion, considering both unconfined and restricted (corralled) motion. We discuss the behaviour of the time averaged mean squared displacement for two prominent stochastic processes, namely, continuous time random walks and fractional Brownian motion. We also study the distribution of the time averaged mean squared displacement around its ensemble mean, and show that this distribution preserves typical process characteristics even for short time series. Recently, velocity correlation functions were suggested to distinguish between these processes. We here present analytical expressions for the velocity correlation functions. The knowledge of the results presented here is expected to be relevant for the correct interpretation of single particle trajectory data in complex systems.},

The remainder of the book is split into two parts: the first part discusses the mathematics of both discrete and continuous wavelet transforms while the second part deals with applications in a variety of subject areas, such as geophysics, medicine, fluid turbulence, engineering testing, speech and sound analysis, image analysis, and data compression. These application chapters make the reader aware of the similarities that exist in the use of wavelet transform analysis across disciplines. A comprehensive list of more than 700 references provides a valuable resource for further study.The book is designed specifically for the applied reader in science, engineering, medicine, finance, or any other of the growing number of application areas. Newcomers to the subject will find an accessible and clear account of the theory of continuous and discrete wavelet transforms, providing a large number of examples of their use across a wide range of disciplines.

Evaluations of the micromixer were conducted to confirm its mixing efficiency for small molecules and macromolecules. This new micromixer enabled us to interrogate the hairpin formation in the early folding process of human telomere G-quadruplex.

Using a flow system containing the protein barstar as a model, we altered the protein's equilibrium conformation by applying the temperature jump and demonstrated that its reactivity with OH free radicals serves as a reporter of the conformational change. Furthermore, we found that the time-dependent increase in mass resulting from free-radical oxidation is a measure of the rate constant for the transition from the unfolded to the first intermediate state.

With decreasing temperature and reduction of the librational motion, we observe an increase in the experimentally measured CQ explaining the discrepancy between experiments and predictions from density functional theory. In addition, at low temperatures and in the absence of 1H decoupling, we observe a well-resolved 1H$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}17O dipole splitting in the spectra, which provides information on the structure of the H2O molecule. The splitting arises because of the homogeneous nature of the coupling between the two 1H$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}17O dipoles and the 1H$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}1H dipole.},

Anomalous diffusion, in which mean squared displacement does not increase linearly with time, is predicted in simulations of solute diffusion in media crowded with fixed or mobile obstacles, or when solute diffusion is restricted or accelerated by a variety of geometric or active transport processes. Experimental measurements of solute diffusion in solutions and cellular aqueous compartments, however, generally show Brownian diffusion. In cell membranes, there are examples of both Brownian and anomalous diffusion, with the latter likely produced by lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. We conclude that the notion of universally anomalous diffusion in cells as a consequence of molecular crowding is not correct and that slowing of diffusion in cells is less marked than has been generally assumed.},

Despite the critical importance of fibrin deformability for outcomes of bleeding and thrombosis, the structural origins of the clot's elasticity and plasticity remain largely unknown. However, there is substantial evidence that unfolding of fibrin is an important part of the mechanism. We used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to reveal force-induced changes in the secondary structure of hydrated fibrin clots made of human blood plasma in vitro. When extended or compressed, fibrin showed a shift of absorbance intensity mainly in the amide I band (1600-1700 cm(-1)) as well as in the amide II and III bands, indicating an increase of the $\beta$-sheets and a corresponding reduction of the $\alpha$-helices. The structural conversions correlated directly with the strain or pressure and were partially reversible at the conditions applied. The additional absorbance observed at 1612-1624 cm(-1) was characteristic of the nascent interchain $\beta$-sheets, consistent with protein aggregation and fiber bundling during clot deformation observed using scanning electron microscopy. We conclude that under extension and/or compression an $\alpha$-helix to $\beta$-sheet conversion of the coiled-coils occurs in the fibrin clot as a part of forced protein unfolding.},

Here, ODNP is employed on an illustrative example of a membrane-active triblock copolymer, poloxamer 188 (P188), which is known to restore the integrity of structurally compromised cell membranes. We observe a distinct change in the translational dynamics of the hydration layer interacting with the lipid membrane surface and the bilayer-interior as P188 is added to a solution of lipid vesicles, but no measurable changes in the dynamics or structure of the lipid membranes. This study shows that hydration water is an integral constituent of a lipid membrane system, and demonstrates for the first time that the modulation of its translational diffusivity can sensitively report on weak polymer-membrane interactions, as well as mediate essential lipid membrane functions. ODNP holds much promise as a unique tool to unravel molecular interactions at interfaces even in the presence of bulk water under ambient conditions.},

We present a true three-dimensional image of a phantom in an ex situ, electromagnet-based system. The basic concepts and designs put forth here extend in a straightforward fashion to higher fields and imaging of larger samples by ex situ methodologies. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the ability of pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy (PDS) to report on the conformation of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) through the sensitive measurement of dipolar interactions between inherent Cu(2+) ions. Although the extent and the anisotropy of the Cu ESR spectrum provides challenges for PDS, Ku-band (17.3 GHz) double electron-electron resonance and double-quantum coherence variants of PDS coupled with distance reconstruction methods recover Cu-Cu distances in good agreement with crystal structures. Moreover, Cu-PDS measurements expose distinct differences between the conformational properties of wild-type SOD1 and a single-residue variant (I149T) that leads to the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The I149T protein displays a broader Cu-Cu distance distribution within the SOD1 dimer compared to wild-type. In a nitroxide (NO)-labeled sample, distance distributions obtained from Cu-Cu, Cu-NO, and NO-NO separations reveal increased structural heterogeneity within the protein and a tendency for mutant dimers to associate. In contrast, perturbations caused by the ALS mutation are completely masked in the crystal structure of I149T. Thus, PDS readily detects alterations in metalloenzyme solution properties not easily deciphered by other methods and in doing so supports the notion that increased range of motion and associations of SOD1 ALS variants contribute to disease progression.},

Thus, free energy differences and activation barriers on the free energy landscape of proteins are rather small. This opens up the possibility of living cells modulating their protein's landscapes, providing cells another way to control the function of their proteomes after transcriptional control, translational control, and post-translational modification. In this Feature Article, we discuss advances in physicochemical studies of protein stability and folding inside living cells. We focus in particular on our studies using fast relaxation imaging (FREI). Although the effect of the cell on protein free energy landscapes is only a few kT, the strong cooperativity of many folding and binding processes allows small modulation of the energy and entropy to produce a large population modulation. Lastly, we discuss some biomolecular processes that are particularly likely to be affected by in-cell modulation of the proteome, and thus of interest for quantitative physical chemistry studies.},

  abstract = {An ultra-stable variable temperature accessory for EPR experiments with biological samples has been designed and tested. The accessory is comprised from a digitally controlled circulator bath that pumps fluid through high-efficiency aluminum radiators attached to an EPR resonator of a commercial X-band EPR spectrometer. Temperature stability of this new accessory after a 15 min re-equilibration is at least +/- 0.007 K. For a standard 1-cm-long capillary sample arranged inside an EPR tube filled with silicon oil, the temperature variations do not exceed +/- 0.033 K over the sample temperature range from 283 to 333 K. This new accessory has been tested by carrying out a comparative spin-labeling EPR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study of the gel-to-liquid phase transition in multilamellar vesicles (MLV) composed of a synthetic phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC). We demonstrate that the gel-to-liquid phase transition temperatures of MLV DMPC measured by EPR and DSC agree within +/- 0.02 K experimental error even though the sample for EPR study was labeled with 1 mol{\%} of 5PC (1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(5-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine). Cooperative unit number measured by EPR, N = 676 +/- 36, was almost 50{\%} higher than that obtained from DSC (N = 458 +/- 18). These high values of N indicate that (i) the lipid domains should include at least several spin-labeled lipid molecules and (ii) the spin-probe 5PC molecules are not excluded into domains that are different from the bulk lipid phase as was speculated earlier. Overall, our data provide DSC and EPR evidence that in studies of the gel-to-liquid phase transition, the effect of bilayer perturbation by spin-labeled lipids is negligible and therefore thermodynamic parameters of the phase transition can be accurately measured by spin-labeling EPR. This might serve as an indication when spin-labeled molecules with structures similar to those of lipids are introduced at low concentrations, they are easily accommodated by fluid phospholipid bilayers without significant losses of the lipid cooperativity.

We obtain and confirm the phase diagram of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (DPPC)-cholesterol binary mixtures versus temperature and provide quantitative descriptions for its dynamic molecular structure using 2D-ELDOR at the Ku band. The spectra from the end-chain 16-PC spin label in multilamellar phospholipid vesicles are obtained for cholesterol molar concentrations ranging from 0 to 50{\%} and from 25 to 60 degrees C. This phase diagram consists of liquid-ordered, liquid-disordered, and gel phases and phase coexistence regions. The phase diagram is carefully examined according to the spectroscopic evidence, and the rigorous interpretation for the line shape changes. We show that the 2D-ELDOR spectra differ markedly with variation in the composition. The extensive line shape changes in the 2D-plus-mixing-time representation provide useful information to define and characterize the membrane phases with respect to their dynamic molecular structures and to determine the phase boundaries. The homogeneous T2's are extracted from the pure absorption spectra and are used to further distinguish the membrane phases. These results show 2D-ELDOR to be naturally suitable for probing and reporting the dynamic structures of microdomains in model membrane systems and, moreover, providing a very detailed picture of their molecular dynamic structure, especially with the aid of the "full Sc- method".},

Two clearly resolved spectral components, distinct in both their ordering and dynamics, are resolved. The major component in membranes composed mostly of DMPC shows typical characteristics, with the long axis of CSL parallel to the bilayer normal with slow (10(6) {\textless}/= R {\textless}/= 10(7) s-1) rotational diffusion rates, as expected for cholesterol. The second component grows in as the mole fraction of DMPS increases. A detailed analysis shows that CSL senses a local, strongly biaxial environment. Our results imply that the inefficient packing between cholesterol and DMPS occurs probably because of the strong interactions between the PS headgroups, which provide the local biaxiality. Such a packing of the headgroups has been predicted by molecular dynamics simulations but had not been observed experimentally. The analysis of these spectral components was greatly aided by the excellent orientational resolution provided by the 250-GHz spectra. This enabled the key qualitative features of this interpretation to be "read" off the spectra before the detailed analysis.},

Confining proteins within the nanoscale interior of a reverse micelle slows water dynamics, allowing global protein-water interactions to be detected using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Complications that normally arise from hydrogen exchange and long-range dipolar coupling are overcome by the nature of the reverse micelle medium. Characterization of the hydration of ubiquitin demonstrates that encapsulation within a reverse micelle allows detection of dozens of hydration waters. Comparison of nuclear Overhauser effects obtained in the laboratory and rotating frames indicate a considerable range of hydration water dynamics is present on the protein surface. In addition, an unprecedented clustering of different hydration-dynamics classes of sites is evident.},

  abstract  = {The electrical characteristics of molecular tunnel junctions are normally determined by DC methods. Using these methods it is difficult to discriminate the contribution of each component of the junctions, e.g., the molecule-electrode contacts, protective layer (if present), or the SAM, to the electrical characteristics of the junctions. Here we show that frequency dependent AC measurements - impedance spectroscopy - make it possible to separate the contribution of each component from each other. We studied junctions that consist of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n-alkanethiolates (S(CH2)n-1CH3  SCn with n = 8, 10, 12, or 14) of the form AgTS-SCn//GaOx/EGaIn (a protective thin ({\~{}}0.7 nm) layer of GaOx forms spontaneously on the surface of EGaIn). The impedance data were recorded as a function of n and fitted to an equivalent circuit consisting of a series resistor (RS; which includes the SAM-electrode contact resistance), the capacitance of the SAM (CSAM), and the resistance of the SAM (RSAM). By plotting RSAM vs. nC, we obtained a value of the tunneling decay constant $\beta$ = 1.03 ± 0.04 nC-1, which is similar to values determined by DC methods. The value of CSAM is similar to previously reported values and RS (2.9-3.6×10-2 $\Omega$•cm2) is dominated by the SAM-top contact resistance (and not by the conductive layer of GaOx) and independent of nC. Using the values of RSAM, we estimated the resistance per molecule r around zero bias as a function of nC; these values of r are similar to values obtained by single molecule experiments. Thus, impedance measurements give detailed information regarding the electrical characteristics of the individual components of SAM-based junctions.},

DNA is becoming a favored nanoscale assembly tool due to the precise pairing of complementary strands that in principle can bring nanoscale objects within a well-defined distance of each other. However, future nanotechnology applications of DNA need to take into account its variable nanoscale structural and dynamic properties, especially in terms of its solvent shell and counterions. This article highlights efforts of the authors to (1) interrogate nanoscale structures of DNA using nanoparticles and (2) measure the dynamic nature of DNA over six orders of magnitude in time, using a fluorescent reporter in the base stack.},

Since the tracer acted as a direct signal source, several of the problems associated with techniques based on traditional dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI contrast agents were avoided. Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated. The MTT was determined to be 2.8 ± 0.8 sec. However, arterial partial-volume effects in the animal model prevented accurate absolute quantification of CBF and CBV. It was demonstrated that depolarization of the hyperpolarized 13C tracer via relaxation and the imaging sequence had little influence on CBF assessment when the time resolution of the imaging sequence was short compared to the MTT. However, CBV and MTT were increasingly underestimated as MTT or the depolarization rate increased if depolarization was not taken into account. With a modified bolus-tracking theory depolarization could be compensated for, assuming that the depolarization rate was known. Three separate compensation methods were investigated experimentally and by numerical simulations. Magn Reson Med 51:464-472, 2004. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND
During protein-folding reactions toward the native structure, short-lived intermediate states can be populated. Such intermediates expose hydrophobic patches and can self-associate leading to non-productive protein misfolding. A major focus of current research is the characterization of short-lived intermediates and how molecular chaperones enable productive folding. Real-time NMR spectroscopy, together with the development of advanced methods, is reviewed here and the potential these methods have to characterize intermediate states as well as interactions with molecular chaperone proteins at single-residue resolution is highlighted. 

SCOPE OF REVIEW
Various chaperone interactions can guide the protein-folding reaction and thus are important for protein structure formation, stability, and activity of their substrates. Chaperone-assisted protein folding, characterization of intermediates, and their molecular interactions using real-time NMR spectroscopy will be discussed. Additionally, recent advances in NMR methods employed for characterization of high-energy intermediates will be discussed. 

MAJOR CONCLUSIONS
Real-time NMR combines high resolution with kinetic information of protein reactions, which can be employed not only for protein-folding studies and the characterization of folding intermediates but also to investigate the molecular mechanisms of assisted protein folding. 

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE
Real-time NMR spectroscopy remains an effective tool to reveal structural details about the interaction between chaperones and transient intermediates. Methodologically, it provides in-depth understanding of how kinetic intermediates and their thermodynamics contribute to the protein-folding reaction. This review summarizes the most recent advances in this field. This article is part of a Special Issue titled Proline-directed Foldases: Cell Signaling Catalysts and Drug Targets.},

  abstract  = {The synthesis of efficient water-oxidation catalysts demands insight into the only known, naturally occurring water-oxidation catalyst, the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII). Understanding the water oxidation mechanism requires knowledge of where and when substrate water binds to the OEC. Mn catalase in its Mn(III)-Mn(IV) state is a protein model of the OEC's S(2) state. From (17)O-labeled water exchanged into the di-$\mu$-oxo di-Mn(III,IV) coordination sphere of Mn catalase, CW Q-band ENDOR spectroscopy revealed two distinctly different (17)O signals incorporated in distinctly different time regimes. First, a signal appearing after 2 h of (17)O exchange was detected with a 13.0 MHz hyperfine coupling. From similarity in the time scale of isotope incorporation and in the (17)O $\mu$-oxo hyperfine coupling of the di-$\mu$-oxo di-Mn(III,IV) bipyridine model (Usov, O. M.; Grigoryants, V. M.; Tagore, R.; Brudvig, G. W.; Scholes, C. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 11886-11887), this signal was assigned to $\mu$-oxo oxygen. EPR line broadening was obvious from this (17)O $\mu$-oxo species. Earlier exchange proceeded on the minute or faster time scale into a non-$\mu$-oxo position, from which (17)O ENDOR showed a smaller 3.8 MHz hyperfine coupling and possible quadrupole splittings, indicating a terminal water of Mn(III). Exchangeable proton/deuteron hyperfine couplings, consistent with terminal water ligation to Mn(III), also appeared. Q-band CW ENDOR from the S(2) state of the OEC was obtained following multihour (17)O exchange, which showed a (17)O hyperfine signal with a 11 MHz hyperfine coupling, tentatively assigned as $\mu$-oxo-(17)O by resemblance to the $\mu$-oxo signals from Mn catalase and the di-$\mu$-oxo di-Mn(III,IV) bipyridine model.},

It was demonstrated that the 2D-FT-ESR experiments provide greatly enhanced resolution to the ordering and dynamics of the end-label, especially when performed as 2D-ELDOR (electron−electron double resonance) experiments as a function of mixing time.

These experiments, over the temperature range of 95°C to 24°C, cover the isotropic (I), nematic (N), smectic A (SA), smectic B (SB), and crystal (C) phases. The 2D-ELDOR (two-dimensional electron–electron double resonance) spectra confirm the anomalously rapid reorientation of PDT, especially in the lower temperature phases. The model of a slowly relaxing local structure {\~{}}SRLS! leads to generally very good non-linear least squares (NLLS) global fits to the sets of 2D-ELDOR spectra obtained at each temperature. These fits are significantly better than those achieved by the standard model of Brownian reorientation in a macroscopic orienting potential. The SRLS model is able to account for anomalies first observed in an earlier 2D-ELDOR study on PDT in a different liquid crystal in its smectic phases. Although it is instructional to extract the various spectral densities from the COSY (correlation spectroscopy) and 2D-ELDOR spectra, the use of NLLS global fitting to a full set of 2D-ELDOR spectra is shown to be more reliable and convenient for obtaining optimum model parameters, especially in view of possible (incipient) slow motional effects from the SRLS or dynamic cage. The cage potential is found to remain fairly constant at about kBT over the various phases (with only a small drop in the SB phase), but its asymmetry increases with decreasing temperature T. This value is significantly larger than the weak macroscopic orienting potential which increases from 0.1 to 0.3kBT with decreasing T. The cage relaxation rate, given by Rc is about 3 x 107 s-1 in the I phase, but increases to about 108 s-1 in the SA , SB , and C phases. The rotational diffusion tensor for PDT shows only a small T-independent asymmetry, and its mean rotational diffusion coefficient is of order 1010 s-1, with however, a small increase in the SB phase. These results are consistent with a model previously proposed for PDT in benzylidene liquid crystal solvents, that as T is reduced the PDT molecules are partially expelled from the hard core (dipolar) region of the liquid crystalline molecules toward the more flexible aliphatic chain region as a result of increased core packing from smectic layer formation, and it thus experiences a more fluid {\~{}}for a given temperature! local cage structure.},

The molecular mechanisms of the initial ligand binding and induced large scale motion of the protein's domains still remain elusive. In this study, we use a new docking protocol that combines a recently proposed explicit water placement algorithm based on the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation and conventional docking software (AutoDock Vina) to explain the mechanisms of maltotriose binding to the apo-open state of a maltose-binding protein. We confirm the predictions of previous NMR spectroscopic experiments on binding modes of the ligand. We provide the molecular details on the binding mode that was not previously observed in the X-ray experiments. We show that this mode, which is defined by the fine balance between the protein-ligand direct interactions and solvation effects, can trigger the protein's domain motion resulting in the holo-closed structure of the maltose-binding protein with the maltotriose ligand in excellent agreement with the experimental data. We also discuss the role of water in blocking unfavorable binding sites and water-mediated interactions contributing to the stability of observable binding modes of maltotriose.},

abstract = {Basic amino acid side chains situated in active sites may mediate critical proton transfers during an enzymatic catalytic cycle. In the case of photosynthetic water oxidation, a strong base is postulated to facilitate the deprotonation of the active site Mn4-Ca cluster, thereby allowing the otherwise thermodynamically constrained transfer of an electron away from the Mn4-Ca cluster to the oxidized redox active tyrosine radical, YZ*, generated by photosynthetic charge separation. Arginine 357 of the CP43 polypeptide may be located in the second coordination shell of the O2-evolving Mn4-Ca cluster of photosystem II (PSII) according to current structural models. An ostensibly conservative substitution mutation, CP43-357K, was investigated using polarographic and fluorescence techniques in evaluating its potential impact on S-state cycling. Cells containing the CP43-357K mutation lost their capacity for autotrophic growth and exhibited a drastic reduction in O2 evolving activity ( approximately 15{\%} of that of the wild type) despite the fact that mutant cells contained more than 80{\%} of the concentration of charge-separating PSII reaction centers and more than half of these contained photooxidizable Mn. Fluorescence kinetics indicated that acceptor side electron transfer, dominated by the transfer of electrons from QA- to QB, was unaffected, but the fraction of centers containing Mn clusters capable of forming the S2 state was reduced to approximately 40{\%} of that of the wild type. Analysis of O2 yields using a bare platinum electrode indicated a severe defect in the S-state cycling properties of the mutant H2O oxidation complexes. Although O2 evolution was delayed to the third flash during a train of single-turnover saturating flashes, the pattern of O2 emission did not exhibit a discernible periodicity indicating a very high miss factor, which was estimated to be approximately 45{\%} compared to the wild-type value of approximately 10{\%}. On the other hand, the multiflash fluorescence measurements indicate that the yield of formation of the S2 state from S1 is diminished by approximately 20{\%}, although this latter estimate is complicated by the presence of damaged PSII centers. Taken together, the experiments indicate that the high miss factor observed during S-state cycling is likely due to a defect in the higher S-state transitions. These results are discussed in relation to the idea that CP43-R357 may serve as a ligand to bicarbonate or as the catalytic base proposed to mediate proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) in the higher S states of the catalytic cycle of H2O oxidation.},

When combined with the CHARMM 19 polar hydrogen energy function, it provides an effective energy function (EEF1) for proteins in solution. The solvation model assumes that the solvation free energy of a protein molecule is a sum of group contributions, which are determined from values for small model compounds. For charged groups, the self-energy contribution is accounted for primarily by the exclusion model. Ionic side-chains are neutralized, and a distance-dependent dielectric constant is used to approximate the charge-charge interactions in solution. The resulting EEF1 is subjected to a number of tests. Molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature of several proteins in their native conformation are performed, and stable trajectories are obtained. The deviations from the experimental structures are similar to those observed in explicit water simulations. The calculated enthalpy of unfolding of a polyalanine helix is found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Results reported elsewhere show that EEF1 clearly distinguishes correctly from incorrectly folded proteins, both in static energy evaluations and in molecular dynamics simulations and that unfolding pathways obtained by high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations agree with those obtained by explicit water simulations. Thus, this energy function appears to provide a realistic first approximation to the effective energy hypersurface of proteins.},

  abstract  = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique, but its low sensitivity and highly sophisticated, costly, equipment severely constrain more widespread applications. Here we show that a non-resonant planar transceiver microcoil integrated in a microfluidic chip (detection volume 25 nl) can detect different nuclides in the full broad-band range of Larmor frequencies (at 9.4 T from 61 to 400 MHz). Routine one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D), homo- and heteronuclear experiments can be carried out using the broad-band coil set-up. Noteworthy, heteronuclear 2D experiments can be performed in a straightforward manner on virtually any combination of nuclides (from classical ¹H-¹³C to more exotic combinations like ¹⁹F-³¹P) both in coupled and decoupled mode. Importantly, the concept of a non-resonant system provides magnetic field-independent NMR probes; moreover, the small-volume alleviates problems related to field inhomogeneity, making the broad-band coil an attractive option for, for example, portable and table-top NMR systems.},

A better understanding of the mechanisms of R5a/R5 sensing of the DNA microenvironment will enhance our capability to relate information from nitroxide spectra to sequence-dependent properties of DNA. Toward this goal, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate R5 and R5a attached as R(p) and S(p) diastereomers at phosphorothioate (pS)C(7) of d(CTACTG(pS)C(7)Y(8)TTAG). d(CTAAAGCAGTAG) (Y = T or U). X-band continuous-wave EPR spectra revealed that the dT(8) to dU(8) change alters nanosecond rotational motions of R(p)-R5a but produces no detectable differences for S(p)-R5a, R(p)-R5, and S(p)-R5. MD simulations were able to qualitatively account for these spectral variations and provide a plausible physical basis for the R5/R5a behavior. The simulations also revealed a correlation between DNA backbone B(I)/B(II) conformations and R5/R5a rotational diffusion, thus suggesting a direct connection between DNA local backbone dynamics and EPR-detectable R5/R5a motion. These results advance our understanding of how a DNA microenvironment influences nitroxide motion and the observed EPR spectra. This may enable use of R5/R5a for a quantitative description of the sequence-dependent properties of large biologically relevant DNA molecules.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) in the liquid state has become the focus of attention to improve the NMR sensitivity of mass limited samples. The Overhauser model predicts a fast reduction in DNP enhancement at high magnetic fields where the electron Larmor frequency exceeds the typical inverse correlation time of the magnetic interaction between an unpaired electron spin of a radical and proton spins of the solvent molecules. The Overhauser hard sphere model is able to predict quantitatively the DNP enhancement for water TEMPOL solutions. The increase in temperature due to dielectric heating of the sample acts to reduce the correlation times and allows a substantial Overhauser DNP. In this paper we extend the work done on water towards other small molecules, such as ethanol. Experimentally we observe a similar enhancement for all three proton groups in the ethanol molecule. The classical interpretation of the low field Overhauser experiments on ethanol invokes a very fast anisotropic rotation of the hydrogen bonded TEMPOL-ethanol complex to explain the fast relaxation of the OH proton. Here we will discuss W-band relaxation and DNP enhancement within this classical model. Although the description can be made quantitative, the invoked parameters do not seem to be realistic. We will propose an alternative model based on the dynamic interaction both in free collision and due to modulation of the hydrogen bond length of the complex.},

Thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of the thermal unfolding of alpha-chymotrypsin, chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease were performed as a function of sucrose concentration. The alteration in protein-solvent interactions in the presence of sucrose was also studied by density measurements and analyzed by multicomponent thermodynamic theory. Sucrose does not induce a conformational change in three proteins studied, although it does induce a small change in the circular dichroism spectrum of ribonuclease. The enthalpy of thermal unfolding shows little dependence on the concentration of sucrose, while the apparent activation energy of the unfolding process is increased by the addition of sucrose. The results from the protein-solvent interaction study indicate that sucrose is preferentially excluded from the protein domain, increasing the free energy of the system. Thermodynamically this leads to protein stabilization since the unfolded state of the protein becomes thermodynamically even less favorable in the presence of sucrose. The exclusion of sucrose from the protein domain seems to be related to the higher cohesive force of the sucrose water solvent system since all the experimental observations can be correlated with the effect of sucrose on the surface tension of water.},

We propose a two-dimensional Diffusion Time Correlation experiment (DTC), which utilizes the double-PFG with a single-direction gradient to yield a two-dimensional correlation function of the diffusion coefficient for two different diffusion times. This correlation map separates out restricted diffusion from the bulk diffusion process and we demonstrate this on a plant and bulk water sample. In its development, we show that the d-PFG should then be thought of as correlating two apparent diffusion coefficients measured by two overlapping gradient waveforms.},

Although the effects of the channel structures and the acidic groups on water/ion transport have been studied before, the surface chemistry or the spatially heterogeneous diffusivity across water channels has never been shown to directly influence water/ion transport. By the use of molecular spin probes that are selectively partitioned into heterogeneous regions of the PEM and Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization relaxometry, this study reveals that both water and proton diffusivity are significantly faster near the fluorocarbon and the acidic groups lining the water channels than within the water channels. The concept that surface chemistry at the (sub)nanometer scale dictates water and proton diffusivity invokes a new design principle for PEMs.},

Pure phase-encoding imaging modalities based on the single-point imaging scheme have demonstrated the feasibility of three-dimensional oximetric images with functional information in minutes. In this article, we explore techniques to improve the temporal resolution and circumvent the relatively short biological half-lives of trityl probes using partial k-space strategies. There are two main approaches: one involves the use of the Hermitian character of the k-space by which only part of the k-space is measured and the unmeasured part is generated using the Hermitian symmetry. This approach is limited in success by the accuracy of numerical estimate of the phase roll in the k-space that corrupts the Hermiticy. The other approach is to measure only a judicially chosen reduced region of k-space (a centrosymmetric ellipsoid region) that more or less accounts for {\textgreater}70{\%} of the k-space energy. Both of these aspects were explored in Fourier transform-EPR imaging with a doubling of scan speed demonstrated by considering ellipsoid geometry of the k-space. Partial k-space strategies help improve the temporal resolution in studying fast dynamics of functional aspects in vivo with infused spin probes.},

This enzyme hyperactivity reaches a peak at 3.0 mm of surfactant. Investigation into the structure of surfactant aggregates indicates "giant" micelle superstructures at this range of surfactant concentration of 1.7 $\mu$m in diameter--dramatically decreasing to 60 and 70 nm at higher surfactant concentrations, while surface tension measurements indicate two critical micelle concentration inflection points at 0.2 and 5.0 mm, which suggests transitions in micelle structure with respect to concentration. Furthermore, electron spin resonance (ESR) indicates that the micelles in first critical micelle concentration regime are loosely packed relative to the second aggregate phase. We hypothesize that this loose packing results in diminished hydration shell repulsion between the micelles, leading to the large, micrometer-sized aggregates. We further hypothesize that it is the interaction with these loosely packed micelles that affects the flexibility of the HRP and protease enzyme structure. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of subtilisin in Brij-30 indicates increasing flexibility of catalytic active site with surfactant concentration. This is correlated with an increase in enzymatic activity.},

To map conformational changes upon binding to the receptor, pairs of spin labels were introduced in arrestin-1 and double electron-electron resonance was used to monitor interspin distance changes upon P-Rh* binding. The results indicate that the relative position of the N and C domains remains largely unchanged, contrary to expectations of a "clam-shell" model. A loop implicated in P-Rh* binding that connects $\beta$-strands V and VI (the "finger loop," residues 67-79) moves toward the expected location of P-Rh* in the complex, but does not assume a fully extended conformation. A striking and unexpected movement of a loop containing residue 139 away from the adjacent finger loop is observed, which appears to facilitate P-Rh* binding. This change is accompanied by smaller movements of distal loops containing residues 157 and 344 at the tips of the N and C domains, which correspond to "plastic" regions of arrestin-1 that have distinct conformations in monomers of the crystal tetramer. Remarkably, the loops containing residues 139, 157, and 344 appear to have high flexibility in both free arrestin-1 and the P-Rh*complex.},

  abstract  = {At a nanometre scale, the behaviour of biological fluids is largely governed by interfacial physical chemistry. This may manifest as slowed or anomalous diffusion. Here we describe how measures developed for studying glassy systems allow quantitative measurement of interfacial effects on water dynamics, showing that correlated motions of particles near a surface result in a viscosity greater than anticipated from individual particle motions. This effect arises as a fundamental consequence of spatial heterogeneity on nanometre length scales and applies to any fluid near any surface. Increased interfacial viscosity also causes the classic finding that large solutes such as proteins diffuse much more slowly than predicted in bulk water. This has previously been treated via an empirical correction to the solute size: the hydrodynamic radius. Using measurements of quantities from theories of glass dynamics, we can now calculate diffusion constants from molecular details alone, eliminating the empirical correction factor.},

  abstract = {Single-sided and mobile nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sensors have the advantages of portability, low cost, and low power consumption compared to conventional high-field NMR and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. We present fast, flexible, and easy-to-implement target field algorithms for mobile NMR and MRI magnet design. The optimization finds a global optimum in a cost function that minimizes the error in the target magnetic field in the sense of least squares. When the technique is tested on a ring array of permanent-magnet elements, the solution matches the classical dipole Halbach solution. For a single-sided handheld NMR sensor, the algorithm yields a 640 G field homogeneous to 16 100 ppm across a 1.9 cm3 volume located 1.5 cm above the top of the magnets and homogeneous to 32 200 ppm over a 7.6 cm3 volume. This regime is adequate for MRI applications. We demonstrate that the homogeneous region can be continuously moved away from the sensor by rotating magnet rod elements, opening the way for NMR sensors with adjustable ldquosensitive volumes.rdquo},

  abstract  = {Biochemical reaction networks consisting of coupled enzymes connect substrate signaling events with biological function. Substrates involved in these reactions can be strongly influenced by diffusion "barriers" arising from impenetrable cellular structures and macromolecules, as well as interactions with biomolecules, especially within crowded environments. For diffusion-influenced reactions, the spatial organization of diffusion barriers arising from intracellular structures, non-specific crowders, and specific-binders (buffers) strongly controls the temporal and spatial reaction kinetics. In this study, we use two prototypical biochemical reactions, a Goodwin oscillator, and a reaction with a periodic source/sink term to examine how a diffusion barrier that partitions substrates controls reaction behavior. Namely, we examine how conditions representative of a densely packed cytosol, including reduced accessible volume fraction, non-specific interactions, and buffers, impede diffusion over nanometer length-scales. We find that diffusion barriers can modulate the frequencies and amplitudes of coupled diffusion-influenced reaction networks, as well as give rise to "compartments" of decoupled reactant populations. These effects appear to be intensified in the presence of buffers localized to the diffusion barrier. These findings have strong implications for the role of the cellular environment in tuning the dynamics of signaling pathways.},

This work focuses on elucidating dynamical and structural modifications of porcine aortic elastin exposed to glucose by solid-state NMR spectroscopic and relaxation methodologies. Results from macroscopic stress-strain tests are also presented and indicate that glucose-treated elastin is mechanically stiffer than the same tissue without glucose treatment. These measurements show a large hysteresis in the stress-strain behavior of glucose-treated elastin$\backslash$textemdash{\{}{\}}a well-known signature of viscoelasticity. Two-dimensional relaxation NMR methods were used to investigate the correlation time, distribution, and population of water in these samples. Differences are observed between the relative populations of water, whereas the measured correlation times of tumbling motion of water across the samples were similar. 13C magic-angle-spinning NMR methods were applied to investigate structural and dynamical modifications after glucose treatment. Although some overall structure is preserved, the process of glucose exposure results in more heterogeneous structures and slower mobility. The correlation times of tumbling motion of the 13C-1H internuclear vectors in the glucose-treated sample are larger than in untreated samples, pointing to their more rigid structure. The 13C cross-polarization spectra reveal a notably increased {\$}\alpha{\$}-helical character in the alanine motifs after glucose exposure. Results from molecular dynamics simulations are provided that add further insight into dynamical and structural changes of a short repeat, [VPGVG]5, an alanine pentamer, desmosine, and isodesmosine sites with and without glucose. The simulations point to changes in the entropic and energetic contributions in the retractive forces of VPGVG and AAAAA motifs. The most notable change is the increase of the energetic contribution in the retractive force due to peptide-glucose interactions of the VPGVG motif, which may play an important role in the observed stiffening in glucose-treated elastin.},

However, information on how much the membrane organization of these lipid-modified proteins impacts on their signaling is still scarce. Ras proteins are organized into membrane nanoclusters, which are necessary for Ras-MAPK signaling. Using quantitative conventional and super-resolution fluorescence methods, as well as mathematical modeling, we investigated nanoclustering of H-ras helix $\alpha$4 and hypervariable region mutants that have different bona fide conformations on the membrane. By following the emergence of conformer-specific nanoclusters in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, we found that conformers impart distinct nanoclustering responses depending on the cytoplasmic levels of the nanocluster scaffold galectin-1. Computational modeling revealed that complexes containing H-ras conformers and galectin-1 affect both the number and lifetime of nanoclusters and thus determine the specific Raf effector recruitment. Our results show that mutations in Ras can affect its nanoclustering response and thus allosterically effector recruitment and downstream signaling. We postulate that cancer- and developmental disease-linked mutations that are associated with the Ras membrane conformation may exhibit so far unrecognized Ras nanoclustering and therefore signaling alterations.},

The key membrane performance issues for hydrogen/air fuel cells are high proton conductivity under dry conditions, low gas crossover, and good mechanical/chemical stability. For direct liquid methanol fuel cells, there is a need for highly durable membranes with a high proton conductivity and low methanol crossover. Fluorinated ionomers continue to dominate the fuel cell membrane landscape and it is unlikely that a hydrocarbon polymer will supplant these materials anytime soon, especially for automotive applications. Promising strategies for improving membrane performance and durability in a hydrogen/air fuel cell include the use of ultra-low equivalent weight semicrystalline ionomers, covalently attaching conductive and water retaining particles to an ionomer, and adding a porous/nanofiber reinforcements to minimize in-plane swelling and shrinking. For direct methanol fuel cells, the best commercial material is Nafion 117, but pre-stretched films of recast Nafion outperform all commercial membranes and show great potential.},

The radicals are generated by laser photolysis of duroquinone in methanol solution containing 10{\%} triethylamine. The duroquinone concentration was varied over a factor of 1000. The rate constant for electron transfer between the radical anion and the neutral duroquinone is 1.5×108M−1s−1 and the intrinsic spin relaxation rates, T−11 and T−12 are 0.32 MHz and 0.44 MHz, respectively. Two-Dimensional magnetization transfer spectra show that the reaction is a homogeneous electron transfer reaction. The electron transfer rates are measured by two novel pulse sequences designed for more efficient data acquisition in samples with no unresolved inhomogeneous broadening. These two sequences result in a more rapid, accurate determination of the second-order chemical rate constant since the second-order rate constant is obtained directly and is not derived from a single measurement of a pseudo-first-order rate. The transient duroquinone radical anions studied here appear to have the same T1, T2 and electron transfer rates as stable duroquinone radical anions in alkaline solutions.},

  abstract = {The structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules in confining or crowded environments are different from those in simple bulk liquids. In this paper, both the conformational and diffusional dynamics of globular polymers are studied in solutions containing fixed spherical obstacles. These properties are studied as a function of obstacle volume fraction and size, as well as polymer chain length. The results are obtained using a hybrid scheme that combines multiparticle collision dynamics of the solvent with molecular dynamics that includes the interactions among the polymer monomers and between the polymer beads and obstacles and solvent molecules. The dynamics accounts for hydrodynamic interactions among the polymer beads and intermolecular forces with the solvent molecules. We consider polymers in poor solvents where the polymer chain adopts a compact globular structure in solution. Our results show that the collapse of the polymer chain to a compact globular state is strongly influenced by the obstacle array. A nonmonotonic variation in the radius of gyration with time is observed and the collapse time scale is much longer than that in simple solutions without obstacles. Hydrodynamic interactions are important at low obstacle volume fractions but are screened at high volume fractions. The diffusion of the globular polymer chain among the obstacles is subdiffusive in character on intermediate time scales where the dynamics explores the local structure of the heterogeneous environment. For large polymer chains in systems with high obstacle volume fractions, the chain adopts bloblike conformations that arise from trapping of portions of the chain in voids among the obstacles.},

  abstract = {Surface and internal water dynamics of molecules and soft matter are of great relevance to their structure and function, yet the experimental determination under ambient and steady-state conditions is challenging. One of the most powerful approaches to measure local water dynamics within 5 A distances is to utilize the modulation of the nuclear spin relaxation rate of water protons through their time-dependent dipolar coupling to paramagnetic probes, here nitroxide spin labels. We recently introduced a method to obtain local water dynamics through Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This has a unique advantage over other related techniques available in that a highly amplified proton nuclear magnetic resonance signal carries the information, allowing the use of minute microliter sample volumes and 100 muM sample concentrations. The outcome of our approach is the quantitative determination of the key DNP parameter known as the coupling factor, which provides local translational diffusion dynamics of the solvent within 5 A of the spin label. In contrast to recent reports that the coupling factor for nitroxide radicals cannot be quantified due to the difficulty in determining the saturation factor for the spin label, we show the saturation factor can be accurately determined and for the first time present agreement between measurements and theory. We discuss the discrepancy between the related field cycling relaxometery technique and DNP in determining the coupling factor and present arguments in support of the DNP-determined value. DNP measurements of local hydration dynamics around nitroxides in bulk water and on the surface of proteins are presented.},

In this contribution, we will focus the attention on the transition from oleate micelles to oleic acid/oleate vesicles induced by a pH change. This transformation is strongly influenced by the presence of pre-formed vesicles. We called this phenomenon the matrix effect. The influence of pre-added POPC liposomes (POPC = 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine) and oleic acid/oleate vesicles on the process rate and on the final size distribution will be discussed elucidating the main differences between these two systems.

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 236.6 and 9.5 GHz probed the tumbling of nitroxide spin probes in the lower stem, in the upper loop, and near the bulge of mini c TAR DNA. High-frequency 236.6 GHz EPR, not previously applied to spin-labeled oligonucleotides, was notably sensitive to fast, anisotropic, hindered local rotational motion of the spin probe, occurring approximately about the NO nitroxide axis. Labels attached to the 2'-aminocytidine sugar in the mini c TAR DNA showed such anisotropic motion, which was faster in the lower stem, a region previously thought to be partially melted. More flexible labels attached to phosphorothioates at the end of the lower stem tumbled isotropically in mini c TAR DNA, mini TAR RNA, and $\psi$(3) RNA, but at 5 °C, the motion became more anisotropic for the labeled RNAs, implying more order within the RNA lower stems. As observed by 9.5 GHz EPR, the slowing of nanosecond motions of large segments of the oligonucleotide was enhanced by increasing the ratio of the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 to mini c TAR DNA from 0 to 2. The slowing was most significant at labels in the loop and near the bulge. At a 4:1 ratio of NCp7 to mini c TAR DNA, all labels reported tumbling times of {\textgreater}5 ns, indicating a condensation of NCp7 and TAR DNA. At the 4:1 ratio, pulse dipolar EPR spectroscopy of bilabels attached near the 3' and 5' termini showed evidence of an NCp7-induced increase in the 3'-5' end-to-end distance distribution and a partially melted stem.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional Fourier Transform ESR (2D FT ESR) spectrometer operating at 9.25 and 17.35 GHz is described. The Ku-band bridge uses an efficient heterodyne technique wherein 9.25 GHz is the intermediate frequency. At Ku-band the sensitivity is increased by almost an order of magnitude. One may routinely collect a full 2D ELDOR spectrum in less than 20 min for a sample containing 0.5-5 nmol of nitroxide spin-probe in the slow-motional regime. Broad spectral coverage at Ku-band is obtained by use of a bridged loop-gap resonator (BLGR) and of a dielectric ring resonator (DR). It is shown that an even more uniform spectral excitation is obtained by using shorter microwave pulses of about 3 ns duration. The dead-time at Ku-band is just 30-40 ns, yielding an improved SNR in 2D ELDOR spectra of nitroxide spin-probes with T2 as short as 20-30 ns. A comparison of 2D ELDOR spectra obtained at 9.25 and 17. 35 GHz for spin-labeled phospholipid probes (16PC) in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) membrane vesicles showed that both spectra could be satisfactorily simulated using the same set of model parameters even though they are markedly different in appearance. The improved sensitivity and shorter dead-time at Ku-band made it possible to obtain orientation-dependent 2D ELDOR spectra of the Cholestane (CSL) spin-probe in macroscopically aligned lipid bilayers of egg yolk PC using samples containing only 1 mg of lipid and just 5 nmol of spin-probe.},

The scanning tunnelling microscope can manipulate individual atoms and molecules on surfaces, but the manipulation of silicon to make atomic-scale logic circuits has been hampered by the covalent nature of its bonds. Resist-based strategies have allowed the formation of atomic-scale structures on silicon surfaces, but the fabrication of working devices-such as transistors with extremely short gate lengths, spin-based quantum computers and solitary dopant optoelectronic devices-requires the ability to position individual atoms in a silicon crystal with atomic precision. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy and hydrogen-resist lithography to demonstrate a single-atom transistor in which an individual phosphorus dopant atom has been deterministically placed within an epitaxial silicon device architecture with a spatial accuracy of one lattice site. The transistor operates at liquid helium temperatures, and millikelvin electron transport measurements confirm the presence of discrete quantum levels in the energy spectrum of the phosphorus atom. We find a charging energy that is close to the bulk value, previously only observed by optical spectroscopy.},

In the ligand-free enzyme the domains AMPbd and LID execute large-amplitude movements controlling substrate binding and product release during catalysis. Domain flexibility is investigated herein with the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) model for (15)N relaxation. SRLS accounts rigorously for coupling between the global and local N-H motions through a local ordering potential exerted by the protein structure at the N-H bond. The latter reorients with respect to its protein surroundings, which reorient on the slower time scale associated with the global protein tumbling. AKeco diffuses globally with correlation time tau(m)=15.1 ns, while locally two different dynamic cases prevail. The domain CORE features ordering about the equilibrium N-H bond orientation with order parameters, S(2), of 0.8-0.9 and local motional correlation times, tau, mainly between 5-130 ps. This represents a conventional rigid protein structure with rapid small-amplitude N-H fluctuations. The domains AMPbd and LID feature small parallel (Z(M)) ordering of S(2)=0.2-0.5 which can be reinterpreted as high perpendicular (Y(M)) ordering. M denotes the local ordering/local diffusion frame. Local motion about Z(M) is given by tau( parallel) approximately 5 ps and local motion of the effective Z(M) axis about Y(M) by tau( perpendicular)=6-11 ns. Z(M) is tilted at approximately 20 degrees from the N-H bond. The orientation of the Y(M) axis may be considered parallel to the C(alpha)(i-1)-C(alpha)(i) axis. The tau( perpendicular) mode reflects collective nanosecond peptide-plane motions, interpretable as domain motion. A powerful new model of protein flexibility/domain motion has been established. Conformational exchange (R(ex)) processes accompany the tau( perpendicular) mode. The SRLS analysis is compared with the conventional model-free analysis.},

The loss of trapped air resulted in a measurable decrease in surface reflectivity and the kinetics of the process was determined in real time and compared to surface properties, such as porosity and morphology. The light-scattering results were compared with measurements of skin-friction drag, static contact angle, and contact-angle hysteresis. The in situ, noninvasive optical technique was shown to correlate well with the more conventional methods for quantifying surface hydrophobicity, such as flow slip and contact angle.},

This effect finds application in biomedical imaging and structural characterization of large biomolecules. In many of these applications nitroxide free radicals are widely used due to their non-toxicity and versatility as site-specific spin labels. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to study the electron-nucleus interaction of the nitroxide radical TEMPOL and water in atomistic detail. Correlation functions corresponding to the dipolar and scalar spin-spin couplings are computed from the simulations. The dynamic nuclear polarization coupling factors deduced from these correlation functions are in good agreement with experiment over a broad range of magnetic field strengths. The present approach can be applied to study solute-solvent interactions in general, and to characterize solvent dynamics on the surfaces of proteins or other spin-labeled biomolecules in particular.},

abstract = {Sensitive probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding challenge in many areas of modern science and technology. In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression and tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level. Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.},

Folding in the cytosol is achieved either on controlled chain release from these factors or after transfer of newly synthesized proteins to downstream chaperones, such as the chaperonins. These are large, cylindrical complexes that provide a central compartment for a single protein chain to fold unimpaired by aggregation. Understanding how the thousands of different proteins synthesized in a cell use this chaperone machinery has profound implications for biotechnology and medicine.},

The two-dimensional distribution functions generally exhibit two distinct components that correspond to the aqueous phase and the liquid fat content. The aqueous phase exhibits a relatively sharp peak, characterized by a large T1/T2 ratio of around 4. The diffusion coefficient and relaxation times are reduced from the values for bulk water by an amount that is sample specific. The fat signal has a similar signature in all samples. It is characterized by a wide T2 distribution and a diffusion coefficient of 10(-11) m2/s for a diffusion time of 40 ms, determined by bounded diffusion in the fat globules of 3 microm diameter.},

abstract = {The use of dielectric spectroscopy to carry out real time observations of cells and to extract a wealth of information about their physiological properties has expanded in recent years. This popularity is due to the simple, easy to use, non-invasive and real time nature of dielectric spectroscopy. The ease of integrating dielectric spectroscopy with microfluidic devices has allowed the technology to further expand into biomedical research. Dielectric spectra are obtained by applying an electrical signal to cells, which is swept over a frequency range. This review covers the different methods of interpreting dielectric spectra and progress made in applications of impedance spectroscopy for cell observations. First, methods of obtaining specific electrical properties of cells (cell membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity) are discussed. These electrical properties are obtained by fitting the dielectric spectra to different models and equations. Integrating models to reduce the effects of the electrical double layer are subsequently covered. Impedance platforms are then discussed including electrical cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Categories of ECIS systems are divided into microelectrode arrays, interdigitated electrodes and those that allow differential ECIS measurements. Platforms that allow single cell and sub-single cell measurements are then discussed. Finally, applications of impedance spectroscopy in a range of cell observations are elaborated. These applications include observing cell differentiation, mitosis and the cell cycle and cytotoxicity/cell death. Future applications such as drug screening and in point of care applications are then covered.},

Deviations between the sets of data appear if there are non-Gaussian diffusion processes occurring on the time-scale defined by the gradient pulse duration and the length-scale defined by the wave vector. The homogeneous length-scale is defined as the minimum length-scale for which the diffusion appears to be Gaussian. Simulations are performed to show that spatial variation of the director orientation in an otherwise homogeneous system is sufficient to induce non-Gaussian diffusion. The method is demonstrated by numerical solutions of the Bloch-Torrey equation and experiments on a range of lamellar liquid crystals with different domain sizes.},

Here we look at the origins of this tendency to understand solute hydration in terms of structural changes in bulk water, and consider the validity of one particular example: the classification of small solutes as chaotropic or kosmotropic, and the putative relation of this terminology to notions of structure-making and structure-breaking in the solvent. We doubt whether complex phenomena such as Hofmeister and osmolyte effects on macromolecules can be understood simply on the basis of a change in solvent structure. Rather, we argue that chaotropicity, if understood in the original sense, arises from the activities that solutes exert on macromolecular systems, as well as from deviations of solvation water from bulk-like behaviour. If applied judiciously, chaotropicity remains a potent, biologically pertinent parameter useful for classifying and understanding solution phenomena in all types of living system.},

We show that the magnitude of the enhancements can be directly related to the effective line width of the central (m(S) = -1/2 → +1/2) EPR transition. Using a Gd(3+) complex with a narrow central transition EPR line width of 29 MHz, we observed a maximum enhancement of ∼13, which is comparable to previous results on the narrow-line-width trityl radical.},

abstract = {The dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of protons, 19F and 13C nuclei were studied in solns. of radicals at 21 kG. The corresponding V-band microwaves (59 GHz) were radiated quasi-optically into the sample placed in a high resolution NMR spectrometer. Several partially Me-and F-substituted benzene derivs. were investigated. The polarization of the protons was neg. and considerably smaller than that obsd. in lower fields. On the other hand, the 19F nuclei gave pos. DNP values of .apprx.10, corresponding to a predominantly scalar coupling with the unpaired electrons. The different pos. and neg. polarizations observed with 13C nuclei can be explained in terms of the 3-spin effect and of mixed scalar and dipolar coupling. This could be further worked out by triple resonance experiments, i.e., by observing the DNP of the 13C nuclei when irradiating the resonance frequencies of the electrons and the protons or 19F nuclei, resp.

  abstract = {Hydration site lifetimes of slowly diffusing water molecules at the protein/DNA interface of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain DNA complex were determined using novel three-dimensional NMR techniques. The lifetimes were calculated using the ratios of ROE and NOE cross-relaxation rates between the water and the protein backbone and side chain amides. This calculation of the lifetimes is based on a model of the spectral density function of the water-protein interaction consisting of three timescales of motion: fast vibrational/rotational motion, diffusion into/out of the hydration site, and overall macromolecular tumbling. The lifetimes measured ranged from approximately 400 ps to more than 5 ns, and nearly all the slowly diffusing water molecules detected lie at the protein/DNA interface. A quantitative analysis of relayed water cross-relaxation indicated that even at very short mixing times. 5 ms for ROESY and 12 ms for NOESY, relay of magnetization can make a small but detectable contribution to the measured rates. The temperature dependences of the NOE rates were measured to help discriminate direct dipolar cross-relaxation from chemical exchange. Comparison with several X-ray structures of homeodomain/DNA complexes reveals a strong correspondence between water molecules in conserved locations and the slowly diffusing water molecules detected by NMR. A homology model based on the X-ray structures was created to visualize the conserved water molecules detected at the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain DNA interface. Two chains of water molecules are seen at the right and left sides of the major groove, adjacent to the third helix of the homeodomain. Two water-mediated hydrogen bond bridges spanning the protein/DNA interface are present in the model, one between the backbone of Phe8 and a DNA phosphate, and one between the side chain of Asn51 and a DNA phosphate. The hydrogen bond bridge between Asn51 and the DNA might be especially important since the DNA contact made by the invariant Asn51 residue, seen in all known homeodomain/DNA structures, is critical for binding affinity and specificity.},

  abstract = {Proteins and other macromolecules can act as molecular machines that convert energy from one form to another through cycles of conformational transitions. In a macroscopically fluctuating environment or at the single-molecule level, the probability for a molecule to be in any state j fluctuates, and the probability current from any other state i to state j is given as the sum of a steady-state current and a pumped current, I(ij)=I(ss)(ij)+F(ij)dP(j)/dt, where F(ij) is the fraction of the fluctuating current into and out of state j coming directly from state i, and dP(j)/dt is the rate of change of the probability for the molecule to be in state j. If the fluctuations arise from an equilibrium source, microscopic reversibility guarantees that the time average of the pumped current is zero. If, however, the fluctuations arise due to the action of a nonequilibrium source, the time average of the pumped current is not in general zero and can be opposite in sign to the steady-state current. The pumped current provides a mechanism by which fluctuations, whether generated externally or arising from an internal nonequilibrium chemical reaction, can do electrical, mechanical, or chemical work on a system by coupling into the equilibrium conformational transitions of a protein. In this review I examine work elaborating the mechanism of stochastic pumping and also discuss a thermodynamically consistent approach for modeling the effects of dynamic disorder on enzymes and other proteins.},

The structure of photosystem II has been reported at resolutions from 3.8 to 2.9 {\AA}. These resolutions have provided much information on the arrangement of protein subunits and cofactors but are insufficient to reveal the detailed structure of the catalytic centre of water splitting. Here we report the crystal structure of photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 {\AA}. From our electron density map, we located all of the metal atoms of the Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster, together with all of their ligands. We found that five oxygen atoms served as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms, and that four water molecules were bound to the Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster; some of them may therefore serve as substrates for dioxygen formation. We identified more than 1,300 water molecules in each photosystem II monomer. Some of them formed extensive hydrogen-bonding networks that may serve as channels for protons, water or oxygen molecules. The determination of the high-resolution structure of photosystem II will allow us to analyse and understand its functions in great detail.},

We apply solution NMR techniques and community analysis of dynamical networks, based on mutual information of correlated protein motions in the active and inactive enzymes. We find evidence that the allosteric pathways in the PRFAR bound enzyme involve conserved residues that correlate motion of the PRFAR binding loop to motion at the protein-protein interface, and ultimately at the glutaminase active site. The imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase bienzyme is an important branch point for the histidine and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways and represents a potential therapeutic target against microbes. The proposed allosteric mechanism and the underlying allosteric pathways provide fundamental insights for the design of new allosteric drugs and/or alternative herbicides.},

Apart from the electron spin-lattice relaxation mechanism, three-spin processes involving two electron spins and a nuclear spin may also play a role in the spin-lattice relaxation of the nuclear spins. Nuclear spins that are close to a paramagnetic impurity center experience large local fields and do not contribute to the NMR signal. Only a small percentage of nuclear spins surrounding an impurity center are polarized directly. The majority of the nuclear spins are polarized by spin diffusion, which is a slow process. A brief overview of a number of paramagnetic impurity centers, which are common in natural diamond, is given and experimental 13C spin-lattice relaxation times for a suite of natural diamonds are compared with calculated values. {\textcopyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In particular, cyanine dyes with excitation wavelengths lambda(ex) {\textgreater} 600 nm are often used in biological applications. However, aggregation behavior and matrix effects on cyanine fluorescence are not fully understood yet and interfere with the data interpretation. In this study, we analyzed the spectroscopic characteristics of a model system consisting of the biotinylated cyanine dyes DY-635 and DY-647 and their streptavidin conjugates. On the basis of the spectroscopic data, the interaction processes between cyanine dye molecules and proteins are discussed. Binding to streptavidin had a significant influence on both fluorescence and anisotropy decays of the cyanine dyes investigated. In particular, the fluorescence anisotropy was significantly altered, making it a promising detection parameter for bioanalytical applications in connection with the cyanine dyes used in the present study. In order to evaluate the time-resolved anisotropy, the introduction of a sophisticated kinetic model was required to describe the contributions from different fluorescing species properly. The rotational motion of streptavidin-bound dyes was analyzed using the associated anisotropy model, which allowed discrimination between contributions from different microenvironments. The anisotropy decay times increased by a factor of up to 20 due to protein binding.},

L64/water/o-xylene and in the binary mixt. L64/water, using ESR spectroscopy with nitroxide spin probes. The spin probes differed in size, structure, and polarity and belong to two main types: (a) cationic probes 4-(N,N-dimethyl-N-alkylammonio)-2,2',6,6'-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl iodide (CATn) with n, the no. of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituent, equal to 1, 4, 8, 11, and 16; (b) amphiphilic probes based on x-doxylstearic acid (xDSA) with x, the carbon atom to which the doxyl group is attached, equal to 5, 7, 10, and 16. X-band ESR spectra reflect the intercalation of the probes in the self-assembled L64 system, but different probes choose different locations in the aggregates and report on the local polarity, hydration, and degree of order. The hydration gradient in the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) core of the reverse micelles was estd. on a scale of ?48 .ANG. from the anal. of aN, the isotropic hyperfine splitting of 14N, in the CATn series by comparison with a $\backslash$"calibration curve$\backslash$" based on CAT4 in aq. solns. of PEO. The lower homologs in the series (n = 1 and 4) are located near the center of the hydrated core, while the higher homologs (n = 11 and 16) are close to the interface between the hydrated core and the o-xylene-swollen poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) blocks. The xDSA probes have their head group near the interface between the core and the PPO regions. The nitroxide group in 5DSA is at the core/PPO interface, but the nitroxide groups in the other doxyl probes are at different depths in the PPO regions, depending on the value of x. The dynamics of the CATn probes was elucidated by comparing the exptl. B and C parameters in the expression for the line width in motionally averaged ESR spectra of nitroxides DH(mI) = A + BmI + CmI2, with the corresponding values calcd. as a function of the direction of the axis of rotation and N, the degree of anisotropy of the rotational reorientation. The comparison suggests that the dominant motional mechanism for all probes is rotation around the N-O bond (x axis), but the anisotropy of the lower spin probe homologs is significantly higher (N = 10) compared to that of the higher homologs (N = 2-3). These results are consistent with the existence of a hydration gradient in the core of the reverse micelles. [on SciFinder (R)]},

This article outlines a Bayesian approach to shrinkage, obtained by placing priors on the wavelet coefficients. The prior for each coefficient consists of a mixture of two normal distributions with different standard deviations. The simple and intuitive form of prior allows us to propose automatic choices of prior parameters. These parameters are chosen adaptively according to the resolution level of the coefficients, typically shrinking high resolution (frequency) coefficients more heavily. Assuming a good estimate of the background noise level, we obtain closed form expressions for the posterior means and variances of the unknown wavelet coefficients. The latter may be used to assess uncertainty in the reconstruction. Several examples are used to illustrate the method, and comparisons are made with other shrinkage methods.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in developing 2D-ELDOR (2D electron–electron double resonance) techniques to better capture molecular dynamics in complex fluids, particularly in model and biological membranes, is reported. The new “full Sc− method”, which corrects the spectral analysis for the phase distortion effects present in the experiments, is demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of 2D-ELDOR in reporting on molecular dynamics in complex membrane environments. That is, instead of performing spectral fitting in the magnitude mode, our new method enables simultaneous fitting of both the real and imaginary components of the Sc− signal. The full Sc− fitting not only corrects the phase distortions in the experimental data but also more accurately determines instrumental dead times. The phase corrections applied to the Sc− spectrum enable the extraction of the pure absorption-mode spectrum, which is characterized by much better resolution than the magnitude-mode spectrum. In the absorption mode, the variation of homogeneous broadening, which reports on the dynamics of the spin probe, can even be observed by visual inspection. This new method is illustrated with results from model membranes of dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC)–cholesterol binary mixtures, as well as with results from plasma membrane vesicles of mast cells. In addition to the dynamic parameters, which provide quantitative descriptions for membranes at the molecular level, the high-resolution absorption spectra themselves may be used as a “fingerprint” to characterize membrane phases and distinguish coexisting components in biomembranes. Thus we find that 2D-ELDOR is greatly improved with the new “full Sc− method” especially for exploring the complexity of model and biological membranes.},

Here, we study the dynamics of water molecules at the active site of a highly proficient enzyme, $\Delta$(5)-3-ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), during a light-activated mimic of its catalytic cycle. Photoexcitation of a nitrile-containing photoacid, coumarin183 (C183), mimics the change in charge density that occurs at the active site of KSI during the first step of the catalytic reaction. The nitrile of C183 is exposed to water when bound to the KSI active site, and we used time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy as a site-specific probe to study the solvation dynamics of water molecules in the vicinity of the nitrile. We observed that water molecules at the active site of KSI are highly rigid, during the light-activated catalytic cycle, compared to the solvation dynamics observed in bulk water. On the basis of this result, we hypothesize that rigid water dipoles at the active site might help in the maintenance of the preorganized electrostatic environment required for efficient catalysis. The results also demonstrate the utility of nitrile probes in measuring the dynamics of local (H-bonded) water molecules in contrast to the commonly used fluorescence methods which measure the average behavior of primary and subsequent spheres of solvation.},

Thermal transition behaviour of the interfacial water incorporated in the nanopores of the C(18) silica materials and the solubility parameter of the water calculated from the distribution coefficients of organic compounds have indicated that the interfacial water may have a structure of disrupted hydrogen bonding. The thickness of the interfacial water or the limit of distance from the hydrophobic surface at which molecules and ions can sense the surface was estimated to be 1.25 ± 0.13 nm from the volume of the interfacial water obtained by a liquid chromatographic method and the surface area, suggesting that the hydrophobic effect may extend beyond the first solvation shell of water molecules directly surrounding the surfaces.},

abstract = {The spin dynamics for Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill-like sequences is analyzed in grossly inhomogeneous B(0) and B(1) fields. This problem is important for many applications, especially when the bandwidth of the signal is excitation limited. Examples include stray-field NMR or inside-out NMR probes used in well logging. The amplitudes of the first few echoes exhibit a characteristic transient behavior but quickly approach a smooth asymptotic behavior. For simple Hamiltonians without scalar or dipolar couplings, the evolution of a refocusing subcycle for a given isochromat is described by a rotation. Simple expressions for the signal of the Nth echo are derived in terms of these effective rotations that have a simple geometrical interpretation. It is shown that the asymptotic behavior is controlled by the direction of the axis of these effective rotations and the signal is dominated by magnetization "spin-locked" to the rotation axis. The phase of the signal is independent of the details of the field inhomogeneities. Relaxation in inhomogeneous fields leads to a signal decay that is in general nonexponential with an initial decay rate that is a weighted sum of T(-1)(1) and T(-1)(2). At long times, the echo amplitudes decay to a finite value. Phase cycling eliminates this offset. The effect of diffusion is also studied. This analysis has been applied to an inside-out NMR well logging apparatus. Good quantitative agreement is found between measurements and calculations that are based on the measured B(0) and B(1) field maps.},

To probe the transition state of ubiquitin thermal unfolding, we examine unfolding dynamics and kinetics of wild-type and mutant ubiquitin using time-resolved nonlinear infrared spectroscopy after a nanosecond temperature jump. We observe spectral changes on two different time scales. A fast nonexponential microsecond phase is attributed to downhill unfolding from the transition state region, which is induced by a shift of the barrier due to the rapid temperature change. Slow millisecond changes arise from thermally activated folding and unfolding kinetics. Mutants that stabilize or destabilize beta strands III-V lead to a decreased or increased amplitude of the microsecond phase, indicating that the disruption or weakening of these strands occurs in the transition state. Unfolding features from microseconds to milliseconds can be explained by temperature-dependent changes of a two-dimensional free energy surface constructed by the native contacts between beta strands of the protein. In addition, the results support the possibility of an intermediate state in thermal unfolding.},

  abstract = {For disordered proteins, the dimensions of the chain are an important property that is sensitive to environmental conditions. We have used single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer to probe the temperature-induced chain collapse of five unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins. Because this behavior is sensitive to the details of intrachain and chain-solvent interactions, the collapse allows us to probe the physical interactions governing the dimensions of disordered proteins. We find that each of the proteins undergoes a collapse with increasing temperature, with the most hydrophobic one, $\lambda$-repressor, undergoing a reexpansion at the highest temperatures. Although such a collapse might be expected due to the temperature dependence of the classical "hydrophobic effect," remarkably we find that the largest collapse occurs for the most hydrophilic, charged sequences. Using a combination of theory and simulation, we show that this result can be rationalized in terms of the temperature-dependent solvation free energies of the constituent amino acids, with the solvation properties of the most hydrophilic residues playing a large part in determining the collapse.},

The analysis of the data obtained in the mid-IR closely resembles the results for wild type PR. The observation of the first ground state intermediate K is initially obscured by a complex reaction scheme of vibrational relaxation and heating effects, but its spectral signature clearly emerges at long delay times. In the visible range, a biexponential decay of the excited state within 30 ps and the formation of the K photoproduct is observed. The decay time constants derived for the D97N mutant in D(2)O are slightly larger than in H(2)O due to H/D exchange. This kinetic isotope effect is even less pronounced than for wild type PR at pH 6. These results support the current notion of a pH dependent hydrogen bonding network in the retinal binding pocket of PR and a weaker interaction between the retinal Schiff base and the counter ion complex compared to bacteriorhodopsin.},

The Diamond Light Source operating in a low alpha mode generated coherent synchrotron radiation that covered a useable spectral bandwidth of 0.3-3.3 THz (10-110 cm(-1)). As the BSA concentration was raised, there was a nonlinear change in absorption inconsistent with Beer's law. At low BSA concentrations (0-1 mM), the absorption remained constant or rose slightly. Above a concentration of 1 mM BSA, a steady decrease in absorption was observed, which was followed by a plateau that started at 2.5 mM. Using a overlapping hydration layer model, the hydration layer was estimated to extend 15 {\AA} from the protein. Calculation of the corrected absorption coefficient ($\alpha$corr) for the water around BSA by subtracting the excluded volume of the protein provides an alternative approach to studying the hydration layer that provides evidence for complexity in the population of water around BSA.},

We tested two different solvent models, TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew, and obtained very similar hydration free energies for these two models; the RMS difference was 0.64 kcal/mol. We found that preferred conformation of the carboxylic acids in water differs from that in vacuum. Surprisingly, this conformational change is not adequately sampled on simulation timescales, so we apply an umbrella sampling technique to include free energies associated with the conformational change. Overall, the results of this test reveal that the force field parameters for some groups of molecules (such as hydroxyl-rich compounds) still need to be improved, but for most compounds, accuracy was consistent with that seen in our previous tests.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy interrogates unpaired electron spins in solids and liquids to reveal local structure and dynamics; for example, EPR has elucidated parts of the structure of protein complexes that other techniques in structural biology have not been able to reveal. EPR can also probe the interplay of light and electricity in organic solar cells and light-emitting diodes, and the origin of decoherence in condensed matter, which is of fundamental importance to the development of quantum information processors. Like nuclear magnetic resonance, EPR spectroscopy becomes more powerful at high magnetic fields and frequencies, and with excitation by coherent pulses rather than continuous waves. However, the difficulty of generating sequences of powerful pulses at frequencies above 100 gigahertz has, until now, confined high-power pulsed EPR to magnetic fields of 3.5 teslas and below. Here we demonstrate that one-kilowatt pulses from a free-electron laser can power a pulsed EPR spectrometer at 240 gigahertz (8.5 teslas), providing transformative enhancements over the alternative, a state-of-the-art ∼30-milliwatt solid-state source. Our spectrometer can rotate spin-1/2 electrons through pi/2 in only 6 nanoseconds (compared to 300 nanoseconds with the solid-state source). Fourier-transform EPR on nitrogen impurities in diamond demonstrates excitation and detection of EPR lines separated by about 200 megahertz. We measured decoherence times as short as 63 nanoseconds, in a frozen solution of nitroxide free-radicals at temperatures as high as 190 kelvin. Both free-electron lasers and the quasi-optical technology developed for the spectrometer are scalable to frequencies well in excess of one terahertz, opening the way to high-power pulsed EPR spectroscopy up to the highest static magnetic fields currently available.},

  abstract = {The adhesion forces between various surfaces were measured using the "surface forces apparatus" technique. This technique allows for the thickness of surface layers and the adhesion force between them to be directly measured in controlled vapor or liquid environments. Three types of biological surfaces were prepared by depositing various lipid-protein monolayers (with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 4 nm) on the inert, molecularly smooth mica surface: (i) hydrophobic lipid monolayers; (ii) amphiphilic polyelectrolyte surfaces of adsorbed polylysine; and (iii) deposited bacterial S-layer proteins. The adhesion, swelling, and wetting properties of these surfaces was measured as a function of relative humidity and time. Initial adhesion is due mainly to the van der Waals forces arising from nonpolar (hydrophobic) contacts. Following adhesive contact, significant molecular rearrangements can occur which alter their hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance and increase their adhesion with time. Increased adhesion is generally enhanced by (i) increased relative humidity (or degree of hydration); (ii) increased contact time; and (iii) increased rates of separation. The results are likely to be applicable to the adhesion of many other biosurfaces, and show that the hydrophobicity of a lipid or protein surface is not an intrinsic property of that surface but depends on its environment (e.g., on whether it is in aqueous solution or exposed to the atmosphere), and on the relative humidity of the atmosphere. It also depends on whether the surface is in adhesive contact with another surface and-when considering dynamic (nonequilibrium) conditions-on the time and previous history of its interaction with that surface.},

  abstract = {High-frequency (250 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in the limit of motional narrowing have been studied for a nitroxide spin probe diffusing in a low-viscosity isotropic solvent. The enhanced sensitivity of the 250-GHz spectrum to rotational modulation of the g tensor reveals new details of the microscopic motion of the spin probe. Specifically, it is shown how independent linear constraints imposed by line-width measurements at 250 GHz and a lower frequency may be used to fully determine the diffusion tensor R in the general case R(x) not-equal R(y) not-equal R(z). This procedure is demonstrated experimentally for the perdeuterated Tempone (PDT) probe diffusing in toluene-d8, where analysis of the line widths obtained at 250 and 9.5 GHz gives values for the anisotropy parameters rho(x) = R(x)/R(z) and rho(y) = R(y)/R(z) of 1.8 +/- 0.2 and 1.5 +/- 0.3, respectively. Thus, this molecule is found to exhibit small deviations from spherically symmetric reorientation. The enhanced accuracy of determining the g tensor from rigid-limit spectra obtained at 250 GHz is an important feature of such high-frequency studies. Existing theoretical expressions for motionally narrowed nitroxide line widths have been modified appropriately for the high-field case by including a completely anisotropic diffusion tensor and the N-14 nuclear Zeeman interaction, which becomes important at fields above about 5 T.},

Recently a PEDRI instrument was modified to also allow CW-EPR spectroscopy with samples of similar size and under the same exptl. conditions. In the present study, this CW-EPR and PEDRI app. was used to assess the feasibility of the detection of a pyrrolidine nitroxide free radical (2,2,5,5,-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl-3-carboxylic acid, PCA) in the abdomen of rats. In particular, we have shown that after the PCA administration (4 mmol kg-1 b.w.): (i) the PCA EPR linewidth does not show line broadening due to concn. effects; (ii) a similar PCA up-take phase is obsd. by EPR and PEDRI; and (iii) the PCA half-lives in the whole abdomen of rats measured with the CW-EPR (T1/2 = 26+-4 min, mean +- sd, n = 10) and PEDRI (T1/2 = 29+-4 min, mean +- sd, n = 4) techniques were not significantly different (p {\textgreater} 0.05).

abstract = {In site-directed spin labeling, a covalently attached nitroxide probe containing a chemically inert unpaired electron is utilized to obtain information on the local environment of the parent macromolecule. Studies presented here examine the feasibility of probing local DNA structural and dynamic features using a class of nitroxide probes that are linked to chemically substituted phosphorothioate positions at the DNA backbone. Two members of this family, designated as R5 and R5a, were attached to eight different sites of a dodecameric DNA duplex without severely perturbing the native B-form conformation. Measured X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, which report on nitroxide rotational motions, were found to vary depending on the location of the label (e.g., duplex center vs termini) and the surrounding DNA sequence. This indicates that R5 and R5a can provide information on the DNA local environment at the level of an individual nucleotide. As these probes can be attached to arbitrary nucleotides within a nucleic acid sequence, they may provide a means to "scan" a given DNA molecule in order to interrogate its local structural and dynamic features.},

Instead, they show a distribution between hydrogen-bonded (HB) and non-hydrogen-bonded (non-HB) states, which is affected by a number of factors in the membrane composition. Similar to the exclusion of solutes from crystallizing solvents, the pure bulk gel phase excludes nitroxides, forcing acyl chains to take bent conformations. In these conformations, the nitroxide is hydrogen-bonded. Furthermore, upon gradual cooling in the supercooled gel, PC labels undergo slow lateral aggregation, resulting in a broad background signal. However, if the sample is instantly frozen, this background is replaced by the HB component. In membranes with cholesterol, the observed HB/non-HB ratio can best be described by a partition-like equilibrium between nitroxides located in defects of lipid structure within the hydrophobic core and those close to the membrane surface.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Numerous imaging techniques have been developed and applied to evaluate brain hemodynamics. Among these are positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, Xenon-enhanced computed tomography, dynamic perfusion computed tomography, MRI dynamic susceptibility contrast, arterial spin labeling, and Doppler ultrasound. These techniques give similar information about brain hemodynamics in the form of parameters such as cerebral blood flow or cerebral blood volume. All of them are used to characterize the same types of pathological conditions. However, each technique has its own advantages and drawbacks. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: This article addresses the main imaging techniques dedicated to brain hemodynamics. It represents a comparative overview established by consensus among specialists of the various techniques. CONCLUSIONS: For clinicians, this article should offer a clearer picture of the pros and cons of currently available brain perfusion imaging techniques and assist them in choosing the proper method for every specific clinical setting.

The computational effort of the overall procedure is order N {\textperiodcentered} log(N) as a function of the sample size N. SureShrink is smoothness adaptive: If the unknown function contains jumps, then the reconstruction (essentially) does also; if the unknown function has a smooth piece, then the reconstruction is (essentially) as smooth as the mother wavelet will allow. The procedure is in a sense optimally smoothness adaptive: It is near minimax simultaneously over a whole interval of the Besov scale; the size of this interval depends on the choice of mother wavelet.

At the critical attraction at which long range correlations disappear, the density profile normal to the surface changes from sigmoidal to layered, and the fluid begins to wet the surface.

Changes in the organization of small unilamellar vesicles were monitored either by ESR (EPR)-in the spectra of doxyl derivs. of stearic acid Me esters labeled at different positions in the acyl chain (5-, 7-, 12- and 16-MeSL)-or by fluorescence, with pyrene fatty-acid (4-, 6-, 10- and 16-Py) probes. The largest effects were obsd. with labels located at the upper positions of the fatty-acid acyl-chain. Dynamic information was obtained by 1H-NMR. Lidocaine protons presented shorter longitudinal relaxation times (T1) values due to their binding, and consequent immobilization to the membrane. In the presence of lidocaine the mobility of all glycerol protons of EPC decreased, while the choline protons revealed a higher degree of mobility, indicating a reduced participation in lipid-lipid interactions. Two-dimensional Nuclear Overhauser Effect expts. detected contacts between arom. lidocaine protons and the phospholipid-choline Me group. Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy spectra revealed that lidocaine changes the access of water to the glycerol region of the bilayer. A $\backslash$"transient site$\backslash$" model for lidocaine preferential location in EPC bilayers is proposed. The model is based on the consideration that insertion of the bulky arom. ring of the anesthetic into the glycerol backbone region causes a decrease in the mobility of that EPC region (T1 data) and an increased mobility of the acyl chains (EPR and fluorescence data).

abstract = {An improved algorithm for determining regularized relaxation time (T1) distributions from inversion-recovery data obtained from fluid-saturated natural porous media (sedimentary rocks), for which the T1 distribution may be interpreted as a distribution of pore sizes, is reviewed. Because the selection of an appropriate value for the regularization parameter is automatic, requiring no user intervention or subjective choices, the data processing can be routinely applied, pixel by pixel, to multiple relaxation-weighted imaging data. This is illustrated with inversion-recovery data resolved in one spatial dimension y, obtained from experiments on the depth filtration of clay in sedimentary rock cores. A new kind of image results, of mixed physical dimensions (the (y, logeT1) plane). These images reveal details of the clay filtration process not previously available from simple profiles of a mean T1, in addition to known artifacts arising from blunders in specimen assembly; in some cases information of interest can be resolved even in the presence of gross artifact. The clay filtration results indicate that although clear reductions in mean T1 result from invasion of the rock pores by suspended clay, significantly larger clay concentrations would be required to distort the overall T1 distribution sufficiently to confuse invaded large pores with small pores containing practically immobile fluid.},

The extent of Tempo water interactions was assessed by the electronic structure calculations. These calculations showed that, at most, two water molecules can hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the nitroxyl group of Tempo, and that a single water molecule forms a hydrogen bond that is ca. 30{\%} stronger than the H2O-H2O hydrogen bond. These calculations led to a postulate that Tempo diffuses along the interface largely unimmersed, and that it is coupled to the interfacial water via hydrogen bonding with H2O. In view of this postulate, the viscosity of the aqueous liquid/vapor interfacial region obtained by interpreting the Tempo diffusion constant in the low concentration region is as much as 4 times smaller than that of bulk liquid water.},

abstract = {The interactions and processes which structure prokaryotic cytoplasm (water, ions, metabolites, and biomacromolecules) and ensure the fidelity of the cell cycle are reviewed from a physicochemical perspective. Recent spectroscopic and biological evidence shows that water has no active structuring role in the cytoplasm, an unnecessary notion still entertained in the literature; water acts only as a normal solvent and biochemical reactant. Subcellular structuring arises from localizations and interactions of biomacromolecules and from the growth and modifications of their surfaces by catalytic reactions. Biomacromolecular crowding is a fundamental physicochemical characteristic of cells in vivo. Though some biochemical and physiological effects of crowding (excluded volume effect) have been documented, crowding assays with polyglycols, dextrans, etc., do not properly mimic the compositional variety of biomacromolecules in vivo. In vitro crowding assays are now being designed with proteins, which better reflect biomacromolecular environments in vivo, allowing for hydrophobic bonding and screened electrostatic interactions. I elaborate further the concept of complex vectorial biochemistry, where crowded biomacromolecules structure the cytosol into electrolyte pathways and nanopools that electrochemically "wire" the cell. Noncovalent attractions between biomacromolecules transiently supercrowd biomacromolecules into vectorial, semiconducting multiplexes with a high (35 to 95{\%})-volume fraction of biomacromolecules; consequently, reservoirs of less crowded cytosol appear in order to maintain the experimental average crowding of ∼25{\%} volume fraction. This nonuniform crowding model allows for fast diffusion of biomacromolecules in the uncrowded cytosolic reservoirs, while the supercrowded vectorial multiplexes conserve the remarkable repeatability of the cell cycle by preventing confusing cross talk of concurrent biochemical reactions.},

  abstract = {Rotational immobilization of proteins permits characterization of the internal peptide and water molecule dynamics by magnetic relaxation dispersion spectroscopy. Using different experimental approaches, we have extended measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the proton-spin-lattice-relaxation rate by one decade from 0.01 to 300 MHz for (1)H and showed that the underlying dynamics driving the protein (1)H spin-lattice relaxation is preserved over 4.5 decades in frequency. This extension is critical to understanding the role of (1)H(2)O in the total proton-spin-relaxation process. The fact that the protein-proton-relaxation-dispersion profile is a power law in frequency with constant coefficient and exponent over nearly 5 decades indicates that the characteristics of the native protein structural fluctuations that cause proton nuclear spin-lattice relaxation are remarkably constant over this wide frequency and length-scale interval. Comparison of protein-proton-spin-lattice-relaxation rate constants in protein gels equilibrated with (2)H(2)O rather than (1)H(2)O shows that water protons make an important contribution to the total spin-lattice relaxation in the middle of this frequency range for hydrated proteins because of water molecule dynamics in the time range of tens of ns. This water contribution is with the motion of relatively rare, long-lived, and perhaps buried water molecules constrained by the confinement. The presence of water molecule reorientational dynamics in the tens of ns range that are sufficient to affect the spin-lattice relaxation driven by (1)H dipole-dipole fluctuations should make the local dielectric properties in the protein frequency dependent in a regime relevant to catalytically important kinetic barriers to conformational rearrangements.},

Understanding how proper function is achieved at the atomic level is crucial to advancing multiple avenues of biomedical research. Biophysical studies often include X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy, providing detailed structural descriptions of these machines. However, their inherent flexibility has complicated an understanding of the relation between structure and function. Solution NMR spectroscopy is well suited to the study of such dynamic complexes, and continued developments have increased size boundaries; insights into function have been obtained for complexes with masses as large as 1 MDa. We highlight methyl-TROSY (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy) NMR, which enables the study of such large systems, and include examples of applications to several cellular machines. We show how this emerging technique contributes to an understanding of cellular function and the role of molecular plasticity in regulating an array of biochemical activities.},

  abstract = {We report pump-probe experiments employing laser-synchronized reactions of para-hydrogen (para-H2) with transition metal dihydride complexes in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection. The pump-probe experiment consists of a single nanosecond laser pump pulse followed, after a precisely defined delay, by a single radio frequency (rf) probe pulse. Laser irradiation eliminates H2 from either Ru(PPh3)3(CO)(H)2 1 or cis-Ru(dppe)2(H)2 2 in C6D6 solution. Reaction with para-H2 then regenerates 1 and 2 in a well-defined nuclear spin state. The rf probe pulse produces a high-resolution, single-scan (1)H NMR spectrum that can be recorded after a pump-probe delay of just 10 $\mu$s. The evolution of the spectra can be followed as the pump-probe delay is increased by micro- or millisecond increments. Due to the sensitivity of this para-H2 experiment, the resulting NMR spectra can have hydride signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 750:1. The spectra of 1 oscillate in amplitude with frequency 1101 ± 3 Hz, the chemical shift difference between the chemically inequivalent hydrides. The corresponding hydride signals of 2 oscillate with frequency 83 ± 5 Hz, which matches the difference between couplings of the hydrides to the equatorial (31)P nuclei. We use the product operator formalism to show that this oscillatory behavior arises from a magnetic coherence in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field that is generated by use of the laser pulse without rf initialization. In addition, we demonstrate how chemical shift imaging can differentiate the region of laser irradiation thereby distinguishing between thermal and photochemical reactivity within the NMR tube.},

  abstract = {Multivalency and preorganization are fundamental aspects of molecular recognition at the lipid membrane-water interface and can render weak monomeric binding interactions selective and robust; this concept is important throughout biology, biotechnology, and materials science. Though hydrogen bonding is typically weakened in water, intramembrane hydrogen bonding between native lipids has been well-studied and is thought to contribute to lipid bioactivity and membrane function. We hypothesized that avidity and preorganization effects at the lipid-water interface could overcome solvent competition and allow for selective hydrogen-bond recognition between small, unstructured components. We have found that electrostatically identical vesicular membranes composed of cyanuric acid and melamine functionalized phospholipids 1 and 2 undergo selective apposition, fusion and adhesion in suspension and on solid support, indicating that their well-known low-dielectric hydrogen bonding properties translate effectively to the lipid-water interface. This work is notable and of general interest given the few detailed studies of aqueous phase hydrogen-bonding systems; we have extensively characterized this system, gaining structural, functional, and thermodynamic data. Furthermore, we have found that the designed lipid-lipid headgroup interactions result in dramatic alteration of the lipid phase morphology, providing insight into the coupling of molecular interactions with assembly state. As such, this work contributes to our understanding of fundamental phenomena such as molecular recognition at the lipid-water interface membrane chemistry and further illustrates the general possibility of designing selective hydrogen-bonding adhesive interactions from simple starting materials at other polar-apolar interfaces; this could have numerous materials and biotechnological applications.},

Successive application of six pulses on the initial density matrix, with appropriate inter-pulse time evolution and coherence pathway selection leaves only the coherent pathways of interest. The amplitude of the echo signal following the last pi pulse can be used to obtain a one-dimensional dipolar spectrum (Pake doublet), and the echo envelope can be used to construct the two-dimensional DQC spectrum. The calculations are carried out using the product space spanned by the two electron-spin magnetic quantum numbers m(1), m(2) and the two nuclear-spin magnetic quantum numbers M(1), M(2), describing e.g. two coupled nitroxides in bilabeled proteins. The density matrix is subjected to a cascade of unitary transformations taking into account dipolar and electron exchange interactions during each pulse and during the evolution in the absence of a pulse. The unitary transformations use the eigensystem of the effective spin-Hamiltonians obtained by numerical matrix diagonalization. Simulations are carried out for a range of dipolar interactions, D, and microwave magnetic field strength B for both fixed and random orientations of the two (14)N (and (15)N) nitroxides. Relaxation effects were not included. Several examples of one- and two-dimensional Fourier transforms of the time domain signals vs. dipolar evolution and spin-echo envelope time variables are shown for illustration. Comparisons are made between 1D rigorous simulations and analytical approximations.

The spin polarization, which is very strong in free soln. even at zero field, was detected using L-band time-resolved ESR (TREPR) spectroscopy with specially modified resonators. The mechanism of formation and decay of low field CIDEP in SCRPs is presented and discussed. The prominent difference between low and high field spectra in micelles is the absence of anti-phase structure for radical 2 with HFI a {\textgreater} B0. This feature is consistent with the proposed polarization mechanism and theor. predictions. [on SciFinder (R)]},

An optical anisotropy decay technique was used to monitor the molecule rotation. The rotation slows down strongly as the aging proceeds. It was shown that the aging dynamics is spatially heterogeneous. The anisotropy decay is well described under the following assumptions: (i) the temperature and structure dependencies of the relaxation time follow the Scherer-Hodge equation and (ii) the time of rotation is proportional to the time of structural relaxation.},

abstract = {The phase behaviour of L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) was examined in aqueous dispersions containing a range of sodium salts. The phase properties of the lipid exhibited a graded response to the presence of simple anions analogous to that of the Hofmeister series encountered in the study of the solution properties of proteins. Salts early in the series (such as Na2SO4 and NaCl) gave rise to substantial decreases in the temperature (Th) of the transition from the lamellar liquid-crystal to inverted hexagonal phase (L alpha----HII) and small increases in the temperature (Tm) of the transition from the lamellar gel to lamellar liquid-crystal phase (L beta----L alpha). Salts towards the end of this series (such as NaI and NaSCN) led to increases in Th and decreases in Tm. Similar effects were seen in lipid dispersions containing a series of non-ionic co-solutes. In both cases, the relative efficiency of perturbation of the lipid phase properties reflected the relative ability of the anion or co-solute to influence the structure of the bulk water. X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that these effects were probably mediated through the ability of the co-solutes to bring about changes in the extent of the lipid/water interface.},

  abstract = {Bacterial receptors typically contain modular architectures with distinct functional domains that combine to send signals in response to stimuli. Although the properties of individual components have been investigated in many contexts, there is little information about how diverse sets of modules work together in full-length receptors. Here, we investigate the architecture of Aer2, a soluble gas-sensing receptor that has emerged as a model for PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) and poly-HAMP (histidine kinase-adenylyl cyclase-methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-phosphatase) domain signaling. The crystal structure of the heme-binding PAS domain in the ferric, ligand-free form, in comparison to the previously determined cyanide-bound state, identifies conformational changes induced by ligand binding that are likely essential for the signaling mechanism. Heme-pocket alternations share some similarities with the heme-based PAS sensors FixL and EcDOS but propagate to the I?? strand in a manner predicted to alter PAS-PAS associations and the downstream HAMP junction within full-length Aer2. Small-angle X-ray scattering of PAS and poly-HAMP domain fragments of increasing complexity allow unambiguous domain assignments and reveal a linear quaternary structure. The Aer2 PAS dimeric crystal structure fits well within ab initio small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelopes, and pulsed dipolar ESR measurements of inter-PAS distances confirm the crystallographic PAS arrangement within Aer2. Spectroscopic and pull-down assays fail to detect direct interactions between the PAS and HAMP domains. Overall, the Aer2 signaling mechanism differs from the Escherichia coli Aer paradigm, where side-on PAS-HAMP contacts are key. We propose an in-line model for Aer2 signaling, where ligand binding induces alterations in PAS domain structure and subunit association that is relayed through the poly-HAMP junction to downstream domains. ??2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Picking peaks from experimental NMR spectra is a key unsolved problem for automated NMR protein structure determination. Such a process is a prerequisite for resonance assignment, nuclear overhauser enhancement (NOE) distance restraint assignment, and structure calculation tasks. Manual or semi-automatic peak picking, which is currently the prominent way used in NMR labs, is tedious, time consuming and costly.

RESULTS: We introduce new ideas, including noise-level estimation, component forming and sub-division, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based peak picking and peak pruning and refinement. PICKY is developed as an automated peak picking method. Different from the previous research on peak picking, we provide a systematic study of the proposed method. PICKY is tested on 32 real 2D and 3D spectra of eight target proteins, and achieves an average of 88{\%} recall and 74{\%} precision. PICKY is efficient. It takes PICKY on average 15.7 s to process an NMR spectrum. More important than these numbers, PICKY actually works in practice. We feed peak lists generated by PICKY to IPASS for resonance assignment, feed IPASS assignment to SPARTA for fragments generation, and feed SPARTA fragments to FALCON for structure calculation. This results in high-resolution structures of several proteins, for example, TM1112, at 1.25 A.

AVAILABILITY: PICKY is available upon request. The peak lists of PICKY can be easily loaded by SPARKY to enable a better interactive strategy for rapid peak picking.},

  abstract = {The interactions of water with solid surfaces govern their apparent hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, influenced at the molecular scale by surface coverage of chemical groups of varied nonpolar/polar character. Recently, it has become clear that the precise patterning of surface groups, and not simply average surface coverage, has a significant impact on the structure and thermodynamics of hydration layer water, and, in turn, on macroscopic interfacial properties. Here we show that patterning also controls the dynamics of hydration water, a behavior frequently thought to be leveraged by biomolecules to influence functional dynamics, but yet to be generalized. To uncover the role of surface heterogeneities, we couple a genetic algorithm to iterative molecular dynamics simulations to design the patterning of surface functional groups, at fixed coverage, to either minimize or maximize proximal water diffusivity. Optimized surface configurations reveal that clustering of hydrophilic groups increases hydration water mobility, while dispersing them decreases it, but only if hydrophilic moieties interact with water through directional, hydrogen-bonding interactions. Remarkably, we find that, across different surfaces, coverages, and patterns, both the chemical potential for inserting a methane-sized hydrophobe near the interface and, in particular, the hydration water orientational entropy serve as strong predictors for hydration water diffusivity, suggesting that these simple thermodynamic quantities encode the way surfaces control water dynamics. These results suggest a deep and intriguing connection between hydration water thermodynamics and dynamics, demonstrating that subnanometer chemical surface patterning is an important design parameter for engineering solid-water interfaces with applications spanning separations to catalysis.},

  abstract = {A methodology for obtaining pure absorption two-dimensional electron spin resonance spectra is presented for the case of large inhomogeneous broadening and/or slow motions. For slow motions, the spectra consist of "complex Lorentzians" superimposed with complex weighting factors, presenting a challenge to obtaining absorption spectra. It is shown how absorption-type spectra can be recovered for the two-pulse COSY and SECSY experiments in such cases. For three-pulse 2D ELDOR experiments, absorption lineshapes can be obtained for the autopeaks, whereas the cross peaks would be of mixed-mode character, in general. However, for practical cases the dispersive components in the cross peaks will be relatively small. Theoretical and experimental absorption spectra are provided to illustrate the method and to show the improved resolution obtained from absorption lineshapes. In particular, the variation in linewidths across a SECSY spectrum, which is a key component in elucidating motional dynamics, is clearly rendered in the pure absorption mode. A convenient method for introducing the necessary phase corrections for the slow-motional spectra is also provided.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Low oxygen concentration (hypoxia) in tumors strongly affects their malignant state and resistance to therapy. These effects may be more deleterious in regions undergoing cycling hypoxia. Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) has provided a noninvasive, quantitative imaging modality to investigate static pO2 in vivo. However, to image changing hypoxia, EPRI images with better temporal resolution may be required. The tradeoff between temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) results in lower SNR for EPRI images with imaging time short enough to resolve cycling hypoxia. METHODS: Principal component analysis allows for accelerated image acquisition with acceptable SNR by filtering noise in projection data, from which pO2 images are reconstructed. Principal component analysis is used as a denoising technique by including only low-order components to approximate the EPRI projection data. RESULTS: Simulated and experimental studies show that principal component analysis filtering increases SNR, particularly for small numbers of sub-volumes with changing pO2 , enabling an order of magnitude increase in temporal resolution with minimal deterioration in spatial resolution or image quality. CONCLUSION: The SNR necessary for dynamic EPRI studies with temporal resolution required to investigate cycling hypoxia and its physiological implications is enabled by principal component analysis filtering.},

We found that upon binding of wt20, the ordering of headgroups and the ordering of acyl chains near the headgroup increased significantly, in a manner consistent with a cooperative phenomenon. However, changes in the order at the end of the acyl chains were negligible. The ordering effect of wt20 on the headgroup was much stronger at pH 5 than at pH 7. No effect of DeltaG1 binding on the order of bilayers was evident. We also found that 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxyl phosphatidylcholine, a membrane-fusion inhibitor, decreased the ordering of DMPC headgroups, whereas arachidonic acid, a membrane-fusion promoter, increased the ordering of DMPC headgroups. These results suggest that increases in headgroup ordering may be important for membrane fusion. We propose that upon binding of wt20, which is known to affect only the outer leaflet of the bilayer, this outer leaflet becomes more ordered, and thus more solid-like. Then the coupling between the hardened outer leaflet and the softer inner leaflet generates bending stresses in the bilayer, which tend to increase the negative curvature of the bilayer. We suggest that the increased ordering in the headgroup region enhances dipolar interactions and lowers electrostatic energy, which may provide an energy source for membrane fusion. Possible roles of bending stresses in promoting membrane fusion are discussed.},

Extensive results on rotational relaxation, in which $\tau$R(T,P) is varied over more than two orders of magnitude, are presented. These results are found to be inconsistent with a simple Stokes–Einstein type $\eta$/T behavior modified with a nonzero intercept. However, the data were successfully fit by the empirical form $\tau$R = c$\eta$$\beta$($\rho$−)/T, where $\beta$ is the isothermal compressibility, c is a constant, and p is an (empirical) reference density whose inverse can be thought of as an ''expanded volume''. Thus, $\rho$−? is a measure of the strength of the anisotropic intermolecular interactions acting on the probe, while $\beta$−1 may be thought of as a measure of the total intermolecular interactions. These results for a solute of molecular size somewhat greater than that of the solvent molecules exhibit some differences when compared to a previous NMR study on neat toluene‐d8. The ϵ parameter introduced by Freed and co‐workers to fit their nonsecular spectral densities is found to be independent of temperature and pressure, and it is pointed out that this could be consistent with an intermolecular fluctuating torque model.},

By introducing thermodynamic stability conditions of liquid mixtures, the variation of activity (or S) as a function of cholesterol mole fraction is utilized to predict the concentration at which the phase separation occurs. These results for DMPC and cholesterol binary mixtures agree very well with those of Tempo-partitioning experiments. The comparison of activity coefficients and the phase boundary in DMPC/cholesterol mixtures with those of POPC/cholesterol mixtures suggests that acyl chain unsaturation leads to poorer mixing of cholesterol in phosphatidylcholine model membranes at higher temperatures (i.e., greater than 35 degrees C). In ternary solutions of DMPC, POPC, and cholesterol, it is found that cholesterol shows less deviation from ideality than in either of the two binary mixtures, and this implies that the phase separation occurs at higher cholesterol concentration than in either of the two binary mixtures. The present analysis suggests that there may not be a critical point in DMPC/cholesterol mixtures, even though phase separation does occur.},

We present a method to quantify the intracellular lifetime of water in cell suspensions with short transverse relaxation times, T2, and also circumvent the confounding effect of different T2 values in the intra- and extracellular compartments. Filter exchange spectroscopy (FEXSY) is specifically sensitive to exchange between compartments with different apparent diffusivities. Our investigation shows that FEXSY could yield significantly biased results if differences in T2 are not accounted for. To mitigate this problem, we propose combining FEXSY with diffusion-relaxation correlation experiment, which can quantify differences in T2 values in compartments with different diffusivities. Our analysis uses a joint constrained fitting of the two datasets and considers the effects of diffusion, relaxation and exchange in both experiments. The method is demonstrated on yeast cells with and without human aquaporins.},

The crystal structure of MalDH from the extreme halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber (Sr) solved at 1.55 {\AA} resolution shows that its surface is strongly enriched in acidic amino acids. The structural comparison of these two models is the first direct observation of the relative impact of acidic surface enrichment on the water structure organization between a halophilic protein and its non-adapted counterpart. The data show that surface acidic amino acids disrupt pentagonal water networks in the hydration shell.

The pO2 measurements from OMRI were found to be in agreement with those obtained by independent polarographic measurements using a pO2 Eppendorf electrode. This work illustrates that anatomically coregistered pO2 maps of tumors can be readily obtained by combining the good anatomical resolution of water proton-based MRI, and the superior pO2 sensitivity of EPR. OMRI affords the opportunity to perform noninvasive and repeated pO2 measurements of the same animal with useful spatial ([approx]1 mm) and temporal (2 min) resolution, making this method a powerful imaging modality for small animal research to understand tumor physiology and potentially for human applications.},

  abstract  = {Many cellular processes require the generation of highly curved regions of cell membranes by interfacial membrane proteins. A number of such proteins are now known, and several mechanisms of curvature generation have been suggested, but so far a quantitative understanding of the importance of the various potential mechanisms remains elusive. Following previous theoretical work, we consider the electrostatic attraction that underlies the scaffold mechanism of membrane bending in the context of the N-BAR domain of amphiphysin. Analysis of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveals considerable water between the membrane and the positively charged concave face of the BAR, even when it is tightly bound to highly curved membranes. This results in significant screening of electrostatic interactions, suggesting that electrostatic attraction is not the main driving force behind curvature sensing, supporting recent experimental work. These results also emphasize the need for care when building coarse-grained models of protein-membrane interactions. These results are emphasized by simulations of oligomerized amphiphysin N-BARs at the atomistic and coarse-grained level. In the coarse-grained simulations, we find a strong dependence of the induced curvature on the dielectric screening.},

This technique is particularly valuable for aligned biological samples in vitro. At 170 GHz, conventional sample preparation techniques based solely on ISDU constrained the sample to be oriented so that the membrane normal was parallel to the applied magnetic field due to the geometry and the millimeter wave field distribution of the Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot resonator used in these experiments. This orientational constraint limited the information that could be obtained from aligned membranes at high field. The combined ISDU/microtome technique overcame this limitation. Spectra from spin-labeled Gramicidin A and the spin label cholestane in aligned DPPC membranes provide a demonstration of the technique. We also discuss some virtues of high field/high frequency ESR on aligned membranes compared to X-band.},

To understand the basis for Ras function, its conformational dynamics were measured in the absence and presence of effectors using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between probes located on the Switch II region and GTP. The time trajectories of FRET efficiency from GTP-bound Ras showed that this conformation spontaneously varies among multiple states. Among them, a low FRET state was identified as an inactive state. The transition involving the inactive conformational state occurred in the time range of seconds. In contrast, fluctuation occurring most probably between multiple active high FRET conformational states lasted approximately 30 ms but converged to a specific conformational state upon binding to an effector. Thus, Ras conformation spontaneously fluctuates to readily interact with various effectors.},

abstract = {Fluorescence solvent relaxation experiments are based on the characterization of time-dependent shifts in the fluorescence emission of a chromophore, yielding polarity and viscosity information about the chromophore's immediate environment. A chromophore applied to a phospholipid bilayer at a well-defined location (with respect to the z-axis of the bilayer) allows monitoring of the hydration and mobility of the probed segment of the lipid molecules. Specifically, time-resolved fluorescence experiments, fluorescence quenching data and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations show that 6-lauroyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Laurdan) probes the hydration and mobility of the sn-1 acyl groups in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. The time-dependent fluorescence shift (TDFS) of Laurdan provides information on headgroup compression and expansion induced by the addition of different amounts of cationic lipids to phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Those changes were predicted by previous MD simulations. Addition of truncated oxidized phospholipids leads to increased mobility and hydration at the sn-1 acyl level. This experimental finding can be explained by MD simulations, which indicate that the truncated chains of the oxidized lipid molecules are looping back into aqueous phase, hence creating voids below the glycerol level. Fluorescence solvent relaxation experiments are also useful in understanding salt effects on the structure and dynamics of lipid bilayers. For example, such experiments demonstrate that large anions increase hydration and mobility at the sn-1 acyl level of phosphatidylcholine bilayers, an observation which could not be explained by standard MD simulations. If polarizability is introduced into the applied force field, however, MD simulations show that big soft polarizable anions are able to interact with the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface of the lipid bilayer, penetrating to the level probed by Laurdan, and that they expand and destabilize the bilayer making it more hydrated and mobile.},

Some of these are based on the distance and angular dependences of pseudo contact shifts (PCSs). When modulated by internal motions PCSs also become sensitive reporters on molecular dynamics. We present here an investigation of the domain-domain motion in a two domain protein (PA0128) through time-modulation of PCSs. PA0128 is a protein of unknown function from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and contains a Zn(2+) binding site in the N-terminal domain. When substituted with Co(2+) in the binding site, several resonances from the C-terminal domain showed severe line broadening along the (15)N dimension. Relaxation compensated CPMG experiments revealed that the dramatic increase in the (15)N linewidth came from contributions of chemical exchange. Since several sites with perturbed relaxation are localized to a single beta-strand region, and since extracted timescales of motion for the perturbed sites are identical, and since the magnitude of the chemical exchange contributions is consistent with PCSs, the observed rate enhancements are interpreted as the result of concerted domain motion on the timescale of a few milliseconds. Given the predictability of PCS differences and the easy interpretation of the experimental results, we suggest that these effects might be useful in the study of molecular processes occurring on the millisecond to microsecond timescale.},

It was found that BSA was able to recognize ss-oligo and ds-oligo upon forming complexes in HCOOH-HCOONa buffer at pH 3.0. When oligonucleotide was added dropwise to BSA, BSA formed a complex with ss-oligo but not with ds-oligo in the studied charge ratio. When BSA was added to oligonucleotides, BSA formed complexes with both ss-oligo and ds-oligo but via different paths: the BSA/ds-oligo underwent two processes, heavy precipitation followed by reentry, with increasing BSA/oligo charge ratio, whereas BSA/ss-oligo underwent only aggregation process, but with a charge reversal occurred at BSA/oligo charge ratio about 0.1. Moreover, the complex formed by BSA and ds-oligo showed a kinetics much slower than that of BSA and ss-oligo. We attributed the big difference upon complexation to the physical nature of oligonucleotides as well as the conformational change of BSA under severe conditions. The differentiation of ss-oligo from ds-oligo by BSA via nonspecific interactions gained insight in the recognition of DNA or RNA by specific protein (enzyme) under physiological conditions.},

  abstract = {NMR spin relaxation of (2)H nuclei in (13)CH(2)D groups is a powerful method for studying side-chain motion in proteins. The analysis is typically carried out with the original model-free (MF) approach adapted to methyl dynamics. The latter is described in terms of axial local motions around, and of, the methyl averaging axis, mutually decoupled and independent of the global motion of the protein. Methyl motion is characterized primarily by the axial squared order parameter, S(axis)2, associated with fluctuations of the methyl averaging axis. This view is shown to be oversimplified by applying to typical experimental data the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) approach of Polimeno and Freed (Adv. Chem. Phys. 1993, 83, 89) which can be considered the generalization of the MF approach. Neglecting mode coupling and the asymmetry of the local ordering and treating approximately features of local geometry imply inaccurate values of S(axis)2, hence of the residual configurational entropy derived from it. S(axis)2, interpreted as amplitude of motion, was found to range from near disorder to almost complete order. Contrary to this picture, we find with the SRLS approach a moderate distribution in the magnitude of asymmetric local ordering and significant variation in its symmetry. The latter important property can be associated implicitly with the contribution of side-chain rotamer jumps. This is consistent with experimental residual dipolar coupling studies and theoretical work based on molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics considerations. Configurational entropy is obtained in the SRLS approach directly from experimentally determined asymmetric potentials. Inconsistency between order parameters from 2H relaxation and from eta(HC-HH) cross-correlation and increase in order parameters with increasing temperature were observed with the MF approach. These discrepancies are reconciled, and physically tenable temperature dependence is obtained with the SRLS approach.},

Herein, using a first-principles approach, we demonstrate that the fluorinated boron nitride nanotube (F-BNNT) quantum dot, which is ferromagnetic in nature, can be used as a perfect spin filter with efficiency as high as 99.8{\%}. Our calculation shows that the ferromagnetic spin ordering in F-BNNT is stable at a higher temperature. Comparison of the conductance value of the F-BNNT quantum dot with that of the pristine BNNT quantum dot reveals a significantly higher conductance in F-BNNT, which is in very good agreement with the experimental report ( Tang, C., et al.

  abstract = {We describe and demonstrate a system to generate hyperpolarized water in the 0.35 T fringe field of a clinical 1.5 T whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet. Once generated, the hyperpolarized water is quickly and continuously transferred from the 0.35 T fringe to the 1.5 T center field of the same magnet for image acquisition using standard MRI equipment. The hyperpolarization is based on Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which effectively and quickly transfers the higher spin polarization of free radicals to nuclear spins at ambient temperatures. We visualize the dispersion of hyperpolarized water as it flows through water-saturated systems by utilizing an observed -15-fold DNP signal enhancement with respect to the unenhanced (1)H MRI signal of water at 1.5 T. The experimental DNP apparatus presented here is readily portable and can be brought to and used with any conventional unshielded MRI system. A new method of immobilizing radicals to gel beads via polyelectrolyte linker arms is described, which led to superior flow Overhauser DNP performance compared to previously presented gels. We discuss the general applicability of Overhauser DNP of water and aqueous solutions in the fringe field of commercially available magnets with central fields up to 4.7 T.},

In contrast, an amino-terminal truncated ras derivative (deleted for 22 amino acid residues) required treatment with urea for its solubilization. The guanine nucleotide binding activity of these four proteins was assessed by a combination of ligand binding on proteins blots, immunoprecipitation, and standard filter binding procedures. The full-length proteins showed similar binding kinetics and a stoichiometry approaching 1 mol of GTP bound per mol of protein.

The carboxyl-terminal truncated protein also bound GTP, but to a reduced extent, whereas the amino-terminal truncated protein did not have binding activity.

The higher coupling factor obtained at this field compared to higher magnetic fields, such as 0.35 T, directly translates to higher enhancement of the NMR signal and opens up a wider time scale window for observing water dynamics interacting with macromolecular systems, including proteins, polymers or lipid vesicles. The higher enhancements obtained will facilitate the observation of water dynamics at correlation times up to 10 ns, that corresponds to more than one order of magnitude slower dynamics than accessible at 0.35 T using X-band ESR frequencies.},

Herein we study the water uptake and proton conductivity of a model fuel cell membrane comprising a triblock copolymer, polystyrenesulfonate-block-polyethylene-block-polystyrenesulfonate (S-SES), as a function of water activity in both humid air and liquid water. We demonstrate that the water uptake and proton conductivity of S-SES membranes equilibrated in liquid water are fundamentally different from values obtained when they were equilibrated in humid air. The morphological underpinnings of our observations were determined by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering and cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy. A discontinuous increase in conductivity when nearly saturated humid air is replaced with liquid water coincides with the emergence of heterogeneity in the hydrated channels: a water-rich layer is sandwiched between two polymer-rich brushes. While the possibility of obtaining heterogeneous hydrated channels in polymer electrolyte membranes has been discussed extensively, to our knowledge, this is the first time that direct evidence for the formation of water-rich subdomains is presented.},

Increases in the aluminum content and evacuation temperature resulted in significant increases in the 129Xe NMR line width and chemical shift of xenon adsorbed on HZSM-5. Similarly, the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal at g=2.000+/-0.005 increased in intensity with increasing Al content or evacuation temperature. In the case of NaZSM-5, evacuation at high temperature did not affect the 129Xe NMR spectrum, and the ESR signal disappeared. These results are attributed to paramagnetic solid-state defects in HZSM-5 arising from the hydroxyl groups that bridge the Al and Si atoms in the zeolite framework.},

The joint refinement necessitated modifications in the orientation of a number of side chains, including the catalytically active lysine-41, which is now thought to form a salt link to the phosphate. Major modifications of the previous model of the bound solvent were necessary. The refinement of all atom occupancies with the neutron data only provided the information about the amide hydrogen exchange. A fourth of all amide hydrogens were found to be at least partially protected from exchange after a year of exchange with D2O.},

The spatial selectivity of this encoding process also opens up new possibilities for compensating magnetic field inhomogeneities; not by demanding extreme uniformities from the B(0) fields, but by compensating for their effects at an excitation and/or refocusing level. This potential is hereby discussed and demonstrated in connection with the single-scan acquisition of high-definition multidimensional images. It is shown that in combination with time-dependent gradient and radiofrequency manipulations, the new compensation approach can be used to counteract substantial field inhomogenities at either global or local levels over relatively long periods of time. The new compensation scheme could find uses in areas where heterogeneities in magnetic fields present serious obstacles, including rapid studies in regions near tissue/air interfaces. The principles of the B(0) compensation method are reviewed for one- and higher-dimensional cases, and experimentally demonstrated on a series of 1D and 2D single-scan MRI experiments on simple phantoms.},

To meet this challenge, we explore the possibility of constructing accurate stochastic models of the spin label dynamics from atomistic trajectories. A systematic, two-step procedure, based on the probabilistic framework of hidden Markov models, is developed to build a discrete-time Markov chain process that faithfully captures the internal spin label dynamics on time scales longer than about 150 ps. The constructed Markov model is used both to gain insight into the long-lived conformations of the spin label and to generate the stochastic trajectories required for the simulation of ESR spectra. The methodology is illustrated with an application to the case of a spin-labeled poly alanine alpha helix in explicit solvent.},

Advances in experimental methods have provided more accurate means of characterizing fast and slow internal motions as well as overall diffusion. The information obtained from NMR dynamics experiments provides insights into specific structural changes or configurational energetics associated with function. A variety of applications illustrate that studies of protein dynamics provide insights into protein-protein interactions, target recognition, ligand binding, and enzyme function.},

  abstract = {Hyperpolarized substrates prepared via dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization have been proposed as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agents for cancer or cardiac failure diagnosis and therapy monitoring through the detection of metabolic impairments in vivo. The use of potentially toxic persistent radicals to hyperpolarize substrates was hitherto required. We demonstrate that by shining UV light for an hour on a frozen pure endogenous substance, namely the glucose metabolic product pyruvic acid, it is possible to generate a concentration of photo-induced radicals that is large enough to highly enhance the (13)C polarization of the substance via dynamic nuclear polarization. These radicals recombine upon dissolution and a solution composed of purely endogenous products is obtained for performing in vivo metabolic hyperpolarized (13)C MRI with high spatial resolution. Our method opens the way to safe and straightforward preclinical and clinical applications of hyperpolarized MRI because the filtering procedure mandatory for clinical applications and the associated pharmacological tests necessary to prevent contamination are eliminated, concurrently allowing a decrease in the delay between preparation and injection of the imaging agents for improved in vivo sensitivity.},

  abstract  = {Viral glycoproteins, such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and human immunodeficiency virus gp41, are anchored by a single helical segment transmembrane domain (TMD) on the viral envelope membrane. The fusion peptides (FP) of the glycoproteins insert into the host membrane and initiate membrane fusion. Our previous study showed that the FP or TMD alone perturbs membrane structure. Interaction between the influenza HA FP and TMD has previously been shown, but its role is unclear. We used PC spin labels dipalmitoylphospatidyl-tempo-choline (on the headgroup), 5PC and 14PC (5-C and 14-C positions on the acyl chain) to detect the combined effect of FP-TMD interaction by titrating HA FP to TMD-reconstituted 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)/cholesterol lipid bilayers using electron spin resonance. We found that the FP-TMD increases the lipid order at all positions, which has a greater lipid ordering effect than the sum of the FP or TMD alone, and this effect reaches deeper into the membranes. Although HA-mediated membrane fusion is pH dependent, this combined effect is observed at both pH 5 and pH 7. In addition to increasing lipid order, multiple components are found for 5PC at increased concentration of FP-TMD, indicating that distinct domains are induced. However, the mutation of Gly1 in the FP and L187 in the TMD eliminates the perturbations, consistent with their fusogenic phenotypes. Electron spin resonance on spin-labeled peptides confirms these observations. We suggest that this interaction may provide a driving force in different stages of membrane fusion: initialization, transition from hemifusion stalk to transmembrane contact, and fusion pore formation.},

abstract = {Despite its short history, wavelet theory has found applications in a remarkable diversity of disciplines: mathematics, physics, numerical analysis, signal processing, probability theory and statistics. The abundance of intriguing and useful features enjoyed by wavelet and wavelet packed transforms has led to their application to a wide range of statistical and signal processing problems. On November 16-18, 1994, a conference on Wavelets and Statistics was held at Villard de Lans, France, organized by the Institute IMAG-LMC, Grenoble, France. The meeting was the 15th in the series of the Rencontres Pranco-Belges des 8tatisticiens and was attended by 74 mathematicians from 12 different countries. Following tradition, both theoretical statistical results and practical contributions of this active field of statistical research were presented. The editors and the local organizers hope that this volume reflects the broad spectrum of the conference. as it includes 21 articles contributed by specialists in various areas in this field. The material compiled is fairly wide in scope and ranges from the development of new tools for non parametric curve estimation to applied problems, such as detection of transients in signal processing and image segmentation. The articles are arranged in alphabetical order by author rather than subject matter. However, to help the reader, a subjective classification of the articles is provided at the end of the book. Several articles of this volume are directly or indirectly concerned with several as pects of wavelet-based function estimation and signal denoising.},

Detailed kinetic modeling of such systems can shed light on the important pathways involved in various transformations and therefore can be used to optimize the process conditions for the desired product composition and properties. This review focuses on elucidating the various components involved in modeling the kinetics of pyrolysis and oxidation of polymers. The elementary free radical steps that constitute the chain reaction mechanism of gas-phase/nonpolar liquid-phase processes are outlined. Specification of the rate coefficients of the various reaction families, which is central to the theme of kinetics, is described. Construction of the reaction network on the basis of the types of end groups and reactive moieties in a polymer chain is discussed. Modeling frameworks based on the method of moments and kinetic Monte Carlo are evaluated using illustrations. Finally, the prospects and challenges in modeling biomass conversion are addressed.},

The exchange frequency was determined by saturation recovery electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using a loop-gap resonator. This method allows use of very low concentrations (less than 1 mM) of chromium oxalate compared with conventional measurements of EPR line broadening (typically 50 mM), thus avoiding problems associated with high metal ion concentration. Differences in exchange frequency between the various positions were also estimated by continuous wave power saturation methods. In either approach, the spin label at lysine 7 was found to be the most exposed to chromium oxalate whereas that at lysine 23 was found to be the least exposed. This is consistent with a model for the membrane bound peptide in which an amphiphilic helix lies with its axis parallel to the bilayer surface and the hydrophobic moment points toward the bilayer interior.},

We vary both the magnitude and direction of the solid surface polarity at the atomic scale and characterize the response of an aqueous interface in terms of the solvent molecular organization and contact angle. We show that when the topography and polarity of the surface act in concert with the asymmetric charge distribution of water, the hydrophobicity varies substantially and, further, can be maximal for a surface with significant polarity. The results suggest that patterning of a surface on several length scales, from atomic to $\mu$m lengths, can make important independent contributions to macroscopic hydrophobicity.},

  abstract  = {Deuterium line shape analysis of CD3 groups has emerged as a particularly useful tool for studying microsecond-millisecond protein motions in the solid state. The models devised so far consist of several independently conceived simple jump-type motions. They are comprised of physical quantities encoded in their simplest form; improvements are only possible by adding yet another simple motion, thereby changing the model. The various treatments developed are case-specific; hence comparison among the different systems is not possible. Here we develop a new methodology for (2)H NMR line shape analysis free of these limitations. It is based on the microscopic-order-macroscopic-disorder (MOMD) approach. In MOMD motions are described by diffusion tensors, spatial restrictions by potentials/ordering tensors, and geometric features by relative tensor orientations. Jump-type motions are recovered in the limit of large orientational potentials. Model improvement is accomplished by monitoring the magnitude, symmetry, and orientation of the various tensors. The generality of MOMD makes possible comparison among different scenarios. CD3 line shapes from the Chicken Villin Headpiece Subdomain and the Streptomyces Subtilisin Inhibitor are used as experimental examples. All of these spectra are reproduced by using rhombic local potentials constrained for simplicity to be given by the L = 2 spherical harmonics, and by axial diffusion tensors. Potential strength and rhombicity are found to be ca. 2-3 k(B)T. The diffusion tensor is tilted at 120° from the C-CD3 axis. The perpendicular (parallel) correlation times for local motion are 0.1-1.0 ms (3.3-30 $\mu$s). Activation energies in the 1.1-8.0 kcal/mol range are estimated. Future prospects include extension to the (2)H relaxation limit, application to the (15)N and (13)C NMR nuclei, and accounting for collective motions and anisotropic media.},

  abstract = {In standard Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) electron spins are polarized at low temperatures in a strong magnetic field and this polarization is transferred to the nuclear spins by means of a microwave field. To obtain high nuclear polarizations cryogenic equipment reaching temperatures of 1 K or below and superconducting magnets delivering several Tesla are required. This equipment strongly limits applications in nuclear and particle physics where beams of particles interact with the polarized nuclei, as well as in neutron scattering science. The problem can be solved using short-lived optically excited triplet states delivering the electron spin. The spin is polarized in the optical excitation process and both the cryogenic equipment and magnet can be simplified significantly. A versatile apparatus is described that allows to perform pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization experiments at X-band using short-lived optically excited triplet sates. The efficient (4)He flow cryostat that cools the sample to temperatures between 4 K and 300 K has an optical access with a coupling stage for a fiber transporting the light from a dedicated laser system. It is further designed to be operated on a neutron beam. A combined pulse ESR/DNP spectrometer has been developed to observe and characterize the triplet states and to perform pulse DNP experiments. The ESR probe is based on a dielectric ring resonator of 7 mm inner diameter that can accommodate cubic samples of 5mm length needed for neutron experiments. NMR measurements can be performed during DNP with a coil integrated in the cavity. With the presented apparatus a proton polarization of 0.5 has been achieved at 0.3 T.},

Two separate derivatives, labeled at sites 44 and 69, were analyzed. The 250-GHz ESR spectra are well described by a microscopic ordering with macroscopic disordering (MOMD) model, which includes the influence of the tether connecting the probe to the protein. In the faster "time scale" of the 250-GHz ESR experiment, the overall rotational diffusion rate of the enzyme is too slow to significantly affect the spectrum, whereas for the 9-GHz ESR spectra, the overall rotational diffusion must be accounted for in the analysis. This is accomplished by using a slowly relaxing local structure model (SRLS) for the dynamics, wherein the tether motion and the overall motion are both included. In this way a simultaneous fit is successfully obtained for both the 250-GHz and 9-GHz ESR spectra. Two distinct motional/ordering modes of the probe are found for both lysozyme derivatives, indicating that the tether exists in two distinct conformations on the ESR time scale. The probe diffuses more rapidly about an axis perpendicular to its tether, which may result from fluctuations of the peptide backbone at the point of attachment of the spin probe.},

  abstract  = {Nitroxide free radicals are the most commonly used source for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and are also exclusively employed as spin labels for electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of diamagnetic molecules and materials. Nitroxide free radicals have been shown to have strong dipolar coupling to (1)H in water, and thus result in large DNP enhancement of (1)H NMR signal via the well known Overhauser effect. The fundamental parameter in a DNP experiment is the coupling factor, since it ultimately determines the maximum NMR signal enhancements which can be achieved. Despite their widespread use, measurements of the coupling factor of nitroxide free radicals have been inconsistent, and current models have failed to successfully explain our experimental data. We found that the inconsistency in determining the coupling factor arises from not taking into account the characteristics of the ESR transitions, which are split into three (or two) lines due to the hyperfine coupling of the electron to the (14)N nuclei (or (15)N) of the nitric oxide radical. Both intermolecular Heisenberg spin exchange interactions as well as intramolecular nitrogen nuclear spin relaxation mix the three (or two) ESR transitions. However, neither effect has been taken into account in any experimental studies on utilizing or quantifying the Overhauser driven DNP effects. The expected effect of Heisenberg spin exchange on Overhauser enhancements has already been theoretically predicted and observed by Bates and Drozdoski [J. Chem. Phys. 67, 4038 (1977)]. Here, we present a new model for quantifying Overhauser enhancements through nitroxide free radicals that includes both effects on mixing the ESR hyperfine states. This model predicts the maximum saturation factor to be considerably higher by the effect of nitrogen nuclear spin relaxation. Because intramolecular nitrogen spin relaxation is independent of the nitroxide concentration, this effect is still significant at low radical concentrations where electron spin exchange is negligible. This implies that the only correct way to determine the coupling factor of nitroxide free radicals is to measure the maximum enhancement at different concentrations and extrapolate the results to infinite concentration. We verify our model with a series of DNP experimental studies on (1)H NMR signal enhancement of water by means of (14)N as well as (15)N isotope enriched nitroxide radicals.},

abstract = {Water proton spin-lattice relaxation is studied in dilute solutions of bovine serum albumin as a function of magnetic field strength, oxygen concentration, and solvent deuteration. In contrast to previous studies conducted at high protein concentrations, the observed relaxation dispersion is accurately Lorentzian with an effective correlation time of 41 {\{}+/-{\}} 3 ns when measured at low proton and low protein concentrations to minimize protein aggregation. Elimination of oxygen flattens the relaxation dispersion profile above the rotational inflection frequency, nearly eliminating the high field tail previously attributed to a distribution of exchange times for either whole water molecules or individual protons at the protein-water interface. The small high-field dispersion that remains is attributed to motion of the bound water molecules on the protein or to internal protein motions on a time scale of order one ns. Measurements as a function of isotope composition permit separation of intramolecular and intermolecular relaxation contributions. The magnitude of the intramolecular proton-proton relaxation rate constant is interpreted in terms of 25 {\{}+/-{\}} 4 water molecules that are bound rigidly to the protein for a time long compared with the rotational correlation time of 42 ns. This number of bound water molecules neglects the possibility of local motions of the water in the binding site; inclusion of these effects may increase the number of bound water molecules by 50{\%}.},

The instrument functions both as an NMR spectrometer operating at 212 MHz (1H frequency) with DNP capabilities, and as a pulsed-EPR operating at 140 GHz. A coiled TE011 resonator acts as both an NMR coil and microwave resonator, and a double balanced (1H, 13C) radio frequency circuit greatly stabilizes the NMR performance. A new 140 GHz microwave bridge has also been developed, which utilizes a four-phase network and ELDOR channel at 8.75 GHz, that is then multiplied and mixed to obtain 140 GHz microwave pulses with an output power of 120 mW. Nutation frequencies obtained are as follows: 6 MHz on S = 1/2 electron spins, 100 kHz on 1H, and 50 kHz on 13C. We demonstrate basic EPR, ELDOR, ENDOR, and DNP experiments here.

Here, the adsorption and electrochemistry of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) is studied on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) as a model sp(2) surface. A major focus is to elucidate whether adsorbed electroactive AQDS can be used as a marker of step edges, which have generally been regarded as the main electroactive sites on graphite electrode surfaces. First, the macroscopic electrochemistry of AQDS is studied on a range of surfaces differing in step edge density by more than 2 orders of magnitude, complemented with ex situ tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) data. These measurements show that step edges have little effect on the extent of adsorbed electroactive AQDS. Second, a new fast scan cyclic voltammetry protocol carried out with scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) enables the evolution of AQDS adsorption to be followed locally on a rapid time scale. Subsequent AFM imaging of the areas probed by SECCM allows a direct correlation of the electroactive adsorption coverage and the actual step edge density of the entire working area. The amount of adsorbed electroactive AQDS and the electron transfer kinetics are independent of the step edge coverage. Last, SECCM reactive patterning is carried out with complementary AFM measurements to probe the diffusional electroactivity of AQDS. There is essentially uniform and high activity across the basal surface of HOPG. This work provides new methodology to monitor adsorption processes at surfaces and shows unambiguously that there is no correlation between the step edge density of graphite surfaces and the observed coverage of electroactive AQDS. The electroactivity is dominated by the basal surface, and studies that have used AQDS as a marker of steps need to be revised.},

Weak dipolar splittings have been previously observed for nitrobenzene in a DC electric field (T. M. Plantenga, et al., Chem. Phys. 66, 1-9, 1982); the use of homogeneous pulsed AC fields has allowed us to establish stable experimental conditions, which were more tolerable to sample impurities and required no sample purification, and to carry out multidimensional experiments. A pulse sequence is discussed in which the electric field is present only for the indirect dimension: this sequence records the dipolar splittings for each proton in the indirect dimension; the direct dimension presents the isotropic chemical shift. Another pulse sequence is discussed that uses the applied electric field only in the mixing period to produce cross peaks between dipolar coupled pairs and correlate their isotropic chemical shifts. The order parameter describing molecular alignment was in good agreement with that previously determined from deuterium quadrupolar measurements of deuterated nitrobenzene in a similar range of electric fields: S(mol) approximately 0.025{\%} for a field strength of 7.0 MV/m (rms).

abstract = {Spin-labeled derivatives of the bee venom protein, melittin, were obtained by reacting on the average one of the four amino groups of the protein with succinimidyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-1-oxyl-3-carboxylate. All 16 statistically possible reaction products with 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 spin labels per protein were then separated in a single pass with reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. With the help of trypsin digestion and diode array detection it was possible to assign the primary structure of all 16 eluting fractions. All fractions with only one spin label per protein were purified for electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. The labeling sites cover different regions of the protein: one is at the N-terminus, one at lysine-7, and two are near the C-terminus at lysine-21 and lysine-23, respectively. This set of specifically labeled melittins was used to study the structure and dynamics of melittin in aqueous solutions and when bound to neutral or negatively charged membranes. In aqueous solution a reduction in rotational correlation time and appearance of spin-spin interaction was observed during salt-induced transition from a random coil monomer to a mostly alpha-helical tetramer. Membrane binding to phospholipid bilayers in low or high ionic strength was reflected only in a further decrease in mobility. The absence of any spin interaction in the membrane-bound state suggests that melittin is monomeric under these conditions. All derivatives were able to detect these structural changes, but melittin labeled at the N-terminal amino group was especially valuable. Because of postulated intramolecular hydrogen bonding, this label reflects directly the motion of the entire protein or tetramer. Broadening experiments with chromium oxalate show that all labeled sites are at least partially exposed to the aqueous phase when melittin is bound to membranes. This suggests that an alpha-helical melittin monomer binds to membranes with its axis parallel to the membrane surface.},

This innovative process is based on the use of toner layers as mask for wet chemical etching. The layouts were projected in graphic software and printed on wax paper using a laser printer. The toner layer was thermally transferred from the paper to cleaned glass surfaces (microscope slides) at 130 degrees C for 2 min. After thermal transference, the glass channel was etched using 25{\%} (v/v) hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. The toner mask was then removed by cotton soaked in acetonitrile. The etching rate was approximately 7.1 +/- 0.6 microm min(-1). This process is economically more attractive than conventional methods because it does not require any sophisticated instrumentation and it can be implemented in any chemical/biochemical laboratory. The glass channel was thermally bonded against a flat glass cover and its analytical feasibility was investigated using capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C(4)D) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection.},

abstract = {Proteorhodopsin, a homologue of archaeal bacteriorhodopsin (BR), belongs to a newly identified family of retinal proteins from marine bacteria, which could play an important role in the energy balance of the biosphere. We cloned the cDNA sequence of proteorhodopsin by chemical gene synthesis, expressed the protein in Escherichia coli cells, purified and reconstituted the protein in its functional active state. The photocycle characteristics were determined by time-resolved absorption and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The pH-dependence of the absorption spectrum indicates that the pKa of the primary acceptor of the Schiff base proton (Asp97) is 7.68. Generally, the photocycle of proteorhodopsin is similar to that of BR, although an L-like photocycle intermediate was not detectable. Whereas at pH{\textgreater}7 an M-like intermediate is formed upon illumination, at pH 5 no M-like intermediate could be detected. As the photocycle kinetics do not change between the acidic and alkaline state of proteorhodopsin, the only difference between these two forms is the protonation status of Asp97. This is corroborated by time-resolved FT-IR spectroscopy, which demonstrates that proton transfer from the retinal Schiff base to Asp97 is observed at alkaline pH, but the other vibrational changes are essentially pH-independent. After reconstitution into proteoliposomes, light-induced proton currents of proteorhodopsin were measured in a compound membrane system where proteoliposomes were adsorbed to planar lipid bilayers. Our results show that proteorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump with characteristics similar to those of BR at alkaline pH. However, at acidic pH, the direction of proton pumping is inverted. Complementary experiments were carried out on proteorhodopsin expressed heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes under voltage clamp conditions. The following results were obtained. (1) At alkaline pH, proteorhodopsin mediates outwardly directed proton pumping like BR. (2) The direction of proton pumping can be inverted, when Asp97 is protonated. (3) The current can be inverted by changes of the polarity of the applied voltage. (4) The light intensity-dependence of the photocurrents leads to the conclusion that the alkaline form of proteorhodopsin shows efficient proton pumping after sequential excitation by two photons.},

In an Escherichia coli cytoplasm model comprised of 15 different macromolecule types at physiological concentrations, BD simulations of molecular-shaped and equivalent sphere representations were performed with a soft repulsive potential. At cellular concentrations, the calculated diffusion constant of GFP is much larger than experiment, with no significant shape dependence. Next, using the equivalent sphere system, hydrodynamic interactions (HI) were considered. Without adjustable parameters, the in vivo experimental GFP diffusion constant was reproduced. Finally, the effects of nonspecific attractive interactions were examined. The reduction in diffusivity is very sensitive to macromolecular radius with the motion of the largest macromolecules dramatically slowed down; this is not seen if HI dominate. In addition, long-lived clusters involving the largest macromolecules form if attractions dominate, whereas HI give rise to significant, size independent intermolecular dynamic correlations. These qualitative differences provide a testable means of differentiating the importance of HI vs. nonspecific attractive interactions on macromolecular motion in cells.},

abstract = {Defective brain insulin signaling has been suggested to contribute to the cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a connection between AD and diabetes has been suggested, a major unknown is the mechanism(s) by which insulin resistance in the brain arises in individuals with AD. Here, we show that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (IRS-1pSer) is common to both diseases. Brain tissue from humans with AD had elevated levels of IRS-1pSer and activated JNK, analogous to what occurs in peripheral tissue in patients with diabetes. We found that amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) oligomers, synaptotoxins that accumulate in the brains of AD patients, activated the JNK/TNF-$\alpha$ pathway, induced IRS-1 phosphorylation at multiple serine residues, and inhibited physiological IRS-1pTyr in mature cultured hippocampal neurons. Impaired IRS-1 signaling was also present in the hippocampi of Tg mice with a brain condition that models AD. Importantly, intracerebroventricular injection of A$\beta$ oligomers triggered hippocampal IRS-1pSer and JNK activation in cynomolgus monkeys. The oligomer-induced neuronal pathologies observed in vitro, including impaired axonal transport, were prevented by exposure to exendin-4 (exenatide), an anti-diabetes agent. In Tg mice, exendin-4 decreased levels of hippocampal IRS-1pSer and activated JNK and improved behavioral measures of cognition. By establishing molecular links between the dysregulated insulin signaling in AD and diabetes, our results open avenues for the investigation of new therapeutics in AD.},

These transporters function by alternating between outward-facing and inward-facing states, in which the substrate binding site is oriented toward the extracellular space and the cytoplasm, respectively. Here we used double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to probe the structure and the state distribution of the subunits in the trimer in distinct hydrophobic environments of detergent micelles and lipid bilayers. Our experiments reveal a conformational ensemble of protomers that sample the outward-facing and inward-facing states with nearly equal probabilities, indicative of comparable energies, and independently of each other. On average, the distributions varied only modestly in detergent and in bilayers, but in several mutants unique conformations were stabilized by the latter.},

  abstract = {Generalized Born (GB) models provide, for many applications, an accurate and computationally facile estimate of the electrostatic contribution to aqueous solvation. The GB models involve two main types of approximations relative to the Poisson equation (PE) theory on which they are based. First, the self-energy contributions of individual atoms are estimated and expressed as "effective Born radii." Next, the atom-pair contributions are estimated by an analytical function f(GB) that depends upon the effective Born radii and interatomic distance of the atom pairs. Here, the relative impacts of these approximations are investigated by calculating "perfect" effective Born radii from PE theory, and enquiring as to how well the atom-pairwise energy terms from a GB model using these perfect radii in the standard f(GB) function duplicate the equivalent terms from PE theory. In tests on several biological macromolecules, the use of these perfect radii greatly increases the accuracy of the atom-pair terms; that is, the standard form of f(GB) performs quite well. The remaining small error has a systematic and a random component. The latter cannot be removed without significantly increasing the complexity of the GB model, but an alternative choice of f(GB) can reduce the systematic part. A molecular dynamics simulation using a perfect-radii GB model compares favorably with simulations using conventional GB, even though the radii remain fixed in the former. These results quantify, for the GB field, the importance of getting the effective Born radii right; indeed, with perfect radii, the GB model gives a very good approximation to the underlying PE theory for a variety of biomacromolecular types and conformations.},

Here we report a time-resolved optical Kerr effect investigation of the vibrational dynamics and relaxation processes in supercooled bulk water. The experiment measures the water intermolecular vibrations and the structural relaxation process in an extended temperature range, and with unprecedented data quality. A mode-coupling analysis of the experimental data enables to characterize the intermolecular vibrational modes and their interplay with the structural relaxation process. The results bring evidence of the coexistence of two local configurations, which are interpreted as high-density and low-density water forms, with an increasing weight of the latter at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Organic osmolytes are small solutes used by cells of numerous water-stressed organisms and tissues to maintain cell volume. Similar compounds are accumulated by some organisms in anhydrobiotic, thermal and possibly pressure stresses. These solutes are amino acids and derivatives, polyols and sugars, methylamines, methylsulfonium compounds and urea. Except for urea, they are often called ;compatible solutes', a term indicating lack of perturbing effects on cellular macromolecules and implying interchangeability. However, these features may not always exist, for three reasons. First, some of these solutes may have unique protective metabolic roles, such as acting as antioxidants (e.g. polyols, taurine, hypotaurine), providing redox balance (e.g. glycerol) and detoxifying sulfide (hypotaurine in animals at hydrothermal vents and seeps). Second, some of these solutes stabilize macromolecules and counteract perturbants in non-interchangeable ways. Methylamines [e.g. trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] can enhance protein folding and ligand binding and counteract perturbations by urea (e.g. in elasmobranchs and mammalian kidney), inorganic ions, and hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea animals. Trehalose and proline in overwintering insects stabilize membranes at subzero temperatures. Trehalose in insects and yeast, and anionic polyols in microorganisms around hydrothermal vents, can protect proteins from denaturation by high temperatures. Third, stabilizing solutes appear to be used in nature only to counteract perturbants of macromolecules, perhaps because stabilization is detrimental in the absence of perturbation. Some of these solutes have applications in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine, including in vitro rescue of the misfolded protein of cystic fibrosis. However, caution is warranted if high levels cause overstabilization of proteins.},

In addition to a microsecond phase, we observe a slower 1.4-ms phase during refolding to the native state. Unlike temperature denaturation, pressure denaturation produces a highly reversible helix-coil-rich state. This difference highlights the importance of the denatured initial condition in folding experiments and leads us to assign a compact nonnative helical trap as the reason for slower P-jump-induced refolding. To complement the experiments, we performed over 50 $\mu$s of all-atom molecular dynamics P-drop refolding simulations with four different force fields. Two of the force fields yield compact nonnative states with misplaced $\alpha$-helix content within a few microseconds of the P-drop. Our overall conclusion from experiment and simulation is that the pressure-denatured state of $\lambda$*YA contains mainly residual helix and little $\beta$-sheet; following a fast P-drop, at least some $\lambda$*YA forms misplaced helical structure within microseconds. We hypothesize that nonnative helix at helix-turn interfaces traps the protein in compact nonnative conformations. These traps delay the folding of at least some of the population for 1.4 ms en route to the native state. Based on molecular dynamics, we predict specific mutations at the helix-turn interfaces that should speed up refolding from the pressure-denatured state, if this hypothesis is correct.},

  abstract = {We report the effect of macromolecular crowding on encapsulation efficiency of fluorescently labeled poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran polymers within individual giant lipid vesicles (GVs). Low concentrations of the fluorescently labeled polymers (82 nM to 186 pM) were mixed with varying concentrations of nonfluorescent polymers that served as crowding agents during vesicle formation by gentle hydration. Encapsulation efficiency of the fluorescently labeled polymers in individual GVs (EEind) was determined via confocal fluorescence microscopy. EEind for high molecular weight polymers (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran 500 and 2000 kDa) increased substantially in the presence of several weight percent unlabeled PEG or dextran. For example, when 0.24 microM FITC dextran 500 kDa was encapsulated, addition of 3{\%} PEG 8 kDa improved the mean concentration in the GVs from 0.14 microM (+/-50{\%}) to 0.24 microM (+/-12{\%}). Light scattering data indicate reduced hydrodynamic radii for polymers as a function of increasing polymer concentration, suggesting that the improvements in EEind result from polymer condensation due to macromolecular crowding. Polymeric cosolutes did not significantly impact EEind for lower molecular weight polymers (e.g., Alexa Fluor 488-PEG 20 kDa), which already encapsulated efficiently (EEind to approximately 1). However, for both the higher and lower molecular weight labeled polymers, cosolutes led to improved uniformity in EEind for vesicles within a batch. Methods for improving the value and homogeneity of EEind for polymeric solutes in lipid vesicles are important in a variety of applications, including the use of vesicles as microreactors and as vehicles for drug delivery.},

Through comparison with molecular simulation, we show that our model captures the length-scale and curvature dependence of solvation free energies with near-quantitative accuracy and two to three orders of magnitude less computational effort, and further, correctly describes the large but rare solvent fluctuations that are involved in dewetting, vapor tube formation and hydrophobic assembly. Our model is intermediate in detail and complexity between implicit-solvent models and explicit-water simulations.},

We explain how 3-d figures can be created using the S2PLOT graphics library, exported to Product Representation Compact (PRC) format, and included as fully interactive, 3-d figures in PDF files using the movie15 LaTeX package. We present new examples of 3-d PDF figures, explain how they have been made, validate them, and comment on their advantages over traditional, static 2-dimensional (2-d) figures. With the judicious use of 3-d rather than 2-d figures, scientists can now publish, share and archive more useful, flexible and faithful representations of their study outcomes. The article you are reading does not have embedded 3-d figures. The full paper, with embedded 3-d figures, is recommended and is available as a supplementary download from PLoS ONE (File S2).},

abstract = {A systematic comparison of the effect of architectural modifications to the network structure on the internal microstructure of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) based hydrogels showed that the addition of a second component to the network significantly increased the proportion of macropores in the network. The second components considered were short poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) chains grafted to the network backbone, high-molecular-weight polyacrylamide (PAM) chains, or microsphere particles of PNIPAM. Structures are proposed for each of the modified gel networks taking into account the new structural information. Through a combination of the pore size and network structure data reported here, and with the shrinking data obtained previously, shrinking mechanisms are proposed for each of the modified network structures. In all cases, the enhanced shrinking rates were directly caused by the presence of the second component, which acted as nuclei for shrinking (graft-PNIPAM and PNIPAM microspheres) or as water-release channels (PAM gel), and indirectly caused by the second components via their affect on the network microstructure.},

In a hydrated protein, at temperatures greater-- similar 220 K, this flexibility is restored, and the protein is able to sample more conformational substates, thus becoming biologically functional. This "dynamical" transition of protein is believed to be triggered by its strong coupling with the hydration water, which also shows a similar dynamic transition. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this sudden switch in dynamic behavior of the hydration water on lysozyme occurs precisely at 220 K and can be described as a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover. At the fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover, the structure of hydration water makes a transition from predominantly high-density (more fluid state) to low-density (less fluid state) forms derived from the existence of the second critical point at an elevated pressure.},

abstract = {The first steps of the photocycle of the D97N mutant of proteorhodopsin (PR) have been investigated by means of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. A comparison with the primary dynamics of native PR and D85N mutant of bacteriorhodopsin is given. Upon photoexcitation of the covalently bound all-trans retinal the excited state decays biexponentially with time constants of 1.4 and 20 ps via a conical intersection, resulting in a 13-cis isomerized retinal. Neither of the two-deactivation channels is significantly preferred. The dynamics is slowed down in comparison with native PR at pH 9 and reaction rates are even lower than for native PR at pH 6, where the primary proton acceptor (Asp97) is protonated. Therefore, the ultrafast isomerization is not only controlled by the charge distribution within the retinal binding pocket. This study shows that in addition to direct electrostatics other effects have to be taken into account to explain the catalytic function of Asp97 in PR on the ultrafast isomerization reaction. This may include sterical interactions and/or bound water molecules within the retinal binding pocket.},

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is now an established tool in clinical imaging and competes favourably with conventional X-ray computerized tomography (CT) scanning. The drive behind NMR imaging has primarily been in the area of whole-body imaging, which has been limited clinically to fields of up to 1.5 T (60 MHz). It is recognized that there may be substantial advantages in obtaining images with sub-millimetre spatial resolution. Also, there may be benefits to imaging at higher fields, since the signal increases as the square of the magnetic field. Using a modified 9.5 T 89-mm-bore high-resolution NMR spectrometer, we have now obtained the first NMR images of a single cell, demonstrating the advent of the NMR imaging microscope. The NMR microscope is expected to have considerable impact in the areas of biology, medicine and materials science, and may serve as a precursor to obtaining such resolutions on human subjects.},

The adsorption-desorption behavior of NO probe molecules is studied at different temperatures for Na-A, Na-ZSM-5, H-ZSM-5, and silicalite. Adsorbed NO molecules form paramagnetic adsorption complexes with Lewis acid sites which can be examined by EPR transitions ([Delta]mS+/-1) at g[approximate]2.0. Otherwise the desorption of NO into the gas phase can be monitored by the typical nine-line EPR spectrum ([Delta]mJ+/-1) of the 2[Pi]3/2 state at g[approximate]0.7776. This gas-phase signal is used to study the overall adsorption-desorption properties of the zeolites in the temperature range 150 K[lsim]T[lsim]300 K. At lower temperatures the probe molecules are adsorbed at the Lewis acid sites inside the nanoporous materials and produce an intensive spectrum at T[lsim]110 K. But at intermediate temperatures 110 K[lsim]T[lsim]150 K the NO molecules are adsorbed only for a few hundred picoseconds because the lifetime of the adsorption complexes is limited by the beginning desorption processes. The decreasing lifetime of the adsorption complex with rising temperature results in an increasing homogeneous line broadening of their EPR signals. An analysis of the line-broadening effects provides an opportunity for determining the specific desorption energies EA(H-ZSM-5)=(20.2+/-7.3) kJ/mol, EA(Na-ZSM-5)=(4.1+/-1.5) kJ/mol, and EA(Na-A)=(7.1+/-2.1) kJ/mol for NO probe molecules at sodium cations and aluminum defect centers just below the desorption temperature.},

  abstract = {A method for obtaining the thermodynamic activity of each membrane component in phosphatidylcholine (PC)/cholesterol mixtures, that is based upon ESR spin labeling is examined. The thermodynamic activity coefficients, gamma PC and gamma chol, for the PC and cholesterol, respectively, are obtained from the measured orientational order parameters, SPC and S(chol), as a function of cholesterol content for a spin-labeled PC and the sterol-type cholestane spin probe (CSL), respectively, and the effects of water concentration are also considered. At water content of 24 weight{\%}, the thermodynamics of DMPC/cholesterol/water mixtures in the liquid-crystalline state may be treated as a two-component solution ignoring the water, but at lower water content the role of water is important, especially at lower cholesterol concentrations. At lower water content (17 wt{\%}), gamma chol decreases with increasing cholesterol content which implies aggregation. However, at higher water content (24 wt{\%}), gamma chol is found initially to increase as a function of cholesterol content before decreasing at higher cholesterol content. This implies a favorable accommodation for the cholesterol in the membrane at high water and low cholesterol content. Good thermodynamic consistency according to the Gibbs-Duhem equation was obtained for gamma PC and gamma chol at 24 wt{\%} water. The availability of gamma chol (and gamma PC) as a function of cholesterol concentration permits the estimate of the boundary for phase separation. The rotational diffusion coefficients of the labeled PC and of CSL were also obtained from the ESR spectra. A previously proposed universal relation for the perpendicular component of the rotational diffusion tensor, R perpendicular, for CSL in PC/cholesterol mixtures (i.e., R perpendicular = R0 perpendicular exp(-AS2chol/RT)) is confirmed. A change in composition of cholesterol or of water for DMPC/cholesterol/water mixtures affects R perpendicular only through the dependence of S(chol) on the composition. In particular, the amount of water affects the membrane fluidity, monitored by R perpendicular for CSL, solely by the structural changes it induces in the membrane for the compositions studied. Rotational diffusion for the labeled PC is found to be more complex, most likely due to the combined action of the internal modes of motion of the flexible chain and of the overall molecular reorientation.},

Although the internal motion of R1 and the number of preferred rotamers are limited, translating interspin distance measurements and spatial orientation information into structural constraints is challenging. Here, we introduce a highly constrained nitroxide side chain designated RX as an alternative to R1 for these applications. RX is formed by a facile cross-linking reaction of a bifunctional methanethiosulfonate reagent with pairs of cysteine residues at i and i + 3 or i and i + 4 in an $\alpha$-helix, at i and i + 2 in a $\beta$-strand, or with cysteine residues in adjacent strands in a $\beta$-sheet. Analysis of EPR spectra, a crystal structure of RX in T4 lysozyme, and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) spectroscopy on an immobilized protein containing RX all reveal a highly constrained internal motion of the side chain. Consistent with the constrained geometry, interspin distance distributions between pairs of RX side chains are narrower than those from analogous R1 pairs. As an important consequence of the constrained internal motion of RX, spectral diffusion detected with ELDOR reveals microsecond internal motions of the protein. Collectively, the data suggest that the RX side chain will be useful for distance mapping by EPR spectroscopy, determining spatial orientation of helical segments in oriented specimens, and measuring structural fluctuations on the microsecond time scale.},

All the osmolytes tested stabilized the protein. The thermal unfolding curve was described well by the van't Hoff equation and the melting temperature and the enthalpy of protein unfolding were obtained. The Wyman-Tanford equation, which describes the unfolded-to-folded protein ratio as a function of water activity, was successfully applied to obtain a linear plot. In consideration of this experimentally obtained linearity, the Wyman-Tanford plot could be integrated to calculate the stabilization free energy of the protein (∆∆G) in the solution. The ∆∆G was proved to be described by the property of the microstructure around the protein surface, which is composed of the protein hydration, the cosolute-binding, and the preferential exclusion, and the property of the bulk solution; water activity. The m-values of osmolytes for protein unfolding were obtained from ∆∆G calculated. Among the osmolytes tested, myo-inositol showed the highest m-value.},

However, in-cell application is hampered by the short lifetime of the commonly used nitroxide spin labels in the reducing milieu inside a cell. Here, we demonstrate that the Gd(III) based spin label Gd-PyMTA is suitable for in-cell EPR. Gd-PyMTA turned out to be cell compatible and was proven to be inert in in-cell extracts of Xenopus laevis oocytes at 18 °C for more than 24 h. The proline rich peptide H-AP10CP10CP10-NH2 was site-directedly spin labeled with Gd-PyMTA at both cysteine moieties. The resulting peptide, H-AP10C(Gd-PyMTA)P10C(Gd-PyMTA)P10-NH2, as well as the model compound Gd-spacer-Gd, which consists of a spacer of well-known stiffness, were microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the Gd(III)-Gd(III) distances were determined by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. To analyze the intracellular peptide conformation, a rotamer library was set up to take the conformational flexibility of the tether between the Gd(III) ion and the C$\alpha$ of the cysteine moiety into account. The results suggest that the spin labeled peptide H-AP10C(Gd-PyMTA)P10C(Gd-PyMTA)P10-NH2 is inserted into cell membranes, coinciding with a conformational change of the oligoproline from a PPII into a PPI helix.},

  abstract = {Decades of molecular dynamics and normal mode calculations suggest that the largest-scale collective vibrational modes of proteins span the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. Experimental investigation of these harmonic, low-amplitude motions, however, has proven challenging. In response, we have developed a vector network analyzer-based spectrometer that supports the accurate measurement of both the absorbance and refractive index of solvated biomolecules over the corresponding gigahertz to terahertz frequency regime, thus providing experimental information regarding their largest-scale, lowest frequency harmonic motions. We have used this spectrometer to measure the complex dielectric response of lysozyme solutions over the range 65 to 700 GHz and an effective medium model to separate the dielectric response of the solvated protein from that of its buffer. In doing so, we find that each lysozyme is surrounded by a tightly bound layer of 165 ± 15 water molecules that, in terms of their picosecond dynamics, behave as if they are an integral part of the protein. We also find that existing computational descriptions of the protein's dynamics compare poorly with the results of our experiment. Specifically, published normal mode and molecular dynamics simulations do not explain the measured dielectric response unless we introduce a cutoff frequency of 250 GHz below which the density of vibrational modes drops to zero. This cutoff is physically plausible, given the known size of the protein and the known speed of sound in proteins, raising questions as to why it is not apparent in computational models of the protein's motions.},

We present systematic studies of the (13)C DNP enhancement of (13)C-labeled small molecules in aqueous solution under ambient conditions, where we observe both dipolar and scalar-mediated enhancement. We show the role of the three-spin effects from enhanced protons on (13)C DNP through DNP experiments with and without broadband (1)H decoupling and by comparing DNP results with H(2)O and D(2)O. We conclude that the efficiency of (13)C Overhauser DNP in small molecules strongly depends on the distance of closest approach between the electron and (13)C nucleus, the presence of a scalar contribution to the coupling factor, and the magnitude of the three-spin effect due to adjacent polarized protons. The enhancement appears to depend less on the translational dynamics of the (13)C-labeled small molecules and radicals.},

Control over proteolysis by the 20S core-particle (CP) proteasome is achieved by gated access of substrate; thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism by which these gates regulate substrate entry is critical. We used methyl-transverse relaxation optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that the amino-terminal residues that compose the gates of the alpha subunits of the Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasome are highly dynamic over a broad spectrum of time scales and that gating termini are in conformations that extend either well inside (closed gate) or outside (open gate) of the antechamber. Interconversion between these conformers on a time scale of seconds leads to a dynamic regulation of 20S CP proteolysis activity.},

  abstract = {Aberrant activation of the small GTPase Ras by oncogenic mutation or constitutively active upstream receptor tyrosine kinases results in the deregulation of cellular signals governing growth and survival in ∼30{\%} of all human cancers. However, the discovery of potent inhibitors of Ras has been difficult to achieve. Here, we report the identification of small molecules that bind to a unique pocket on the Ras:Son of Sevenless (SOS):Ras complex, increase the rate of SOS-catalyzed nucleotide exchange in vitro, and modulate Ras signaling pathways in cells. X-ray crystallography of Ras:SOS:Ras in complex with these molecules reveals that the compounds bind in a hydrophobic pocket in the CDC25 domain of SOS adjacent to the Switch II region of Ras. The structure-activity relationships exhibited by these compounds can be rationalized on the basis of multiple X-ray cocrystal structures. Mutational analyses confirmed the functional relevance of this binding site and showed it to be essential for compound activity. These molecules increase Ras-GTP levels and disrupt MAPK and PI3K signaling in cells at low micromolar concentrations. These small molecules represent tools to study the acute activation of Ras and highlight a pocket on SOS that may be exploited to modulate Ras signaling.},

The species can be introduced by site-directed spin labeling, which offers precise control for positioning the label in the sequence of a biopolymer. However, internal flexibility of the spin label gives rise to dynamic processes that potentially influence PRE and DNP behavior and leads to a spatial distribution of the electron spin even in solid samples. Internal dynamics of spin labels and their static conformational distributions have been studied mainly by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, with a large body of results for the most widely applied methanethiosulfonate spin label MTSL. These results are critically discussed in a unifying picture based on rotameric states of the group that carries the spin label. Deficiencies in our current understanding of dynamics and conformations of spin labeled groups and of their influence on NMR observables are highlighted and directions for further research suggested.},

By way of (1)H-(13)C cross-polarization, we obtained a DNP enhancement ($\epsilon$) of 58 for 95{\%} deuterated OTP in the amorphous state using the biradical bis-TEMPO terephthalate (bTtereph) and $\epsilon$ of 36 in the crystalline state. Measurements of the (1)H T1 and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments showed the crystallization process led to phase separation of the polarization agent, creating an inhomogeneous distribution of radicals within the sample. Consequently, the effective radical concentration was decreased in the bulk OTP phase, and long-range (1)H-(1)H spin diffusion was the main polarization propagation mechanism. Preliminary DNP experiments with the glass-forming anti-inflammation drug, indomethacin, showed promising results, and further studies are underway to prepare DNP samples using pharmaceutical techniques.},

The EPR-detectable spin density has been determined, as has been the temperature- and frequency-dependence of the oxygen broadening of the EPR signal, which is orders of magnitude larger than that observed with other materials, such as lithium phthalocyanine. Three Lorentzian components are required to fit the char EPR spectrum in the presence of oxygen, and the oxygen-dependence of the line width, intensity, and resonance position of the three components have been quantified. These results and the properties of porous carbonaceous materials are used to develop a model to explain the effect of oxygen on the char EPR spectral properties. The model is based on oxygen adsorption on the char surface according to a Langmuir isotherm and a dipolar interaction between the paramagnetic adsorbed gas and the charcoal spins. The three EPR components are correlated with the three known classes (sizes) of pores in charcoal, with the largest line broadening attributed to dipolar relaxation of spins in micropores, which have a larger specific surface area and a higher concentration of adsorbed oxygen. An attenuated, but similar, EPR response to oxygen by chars when they are immersed in aqueous solution is attributed to water competition with oxygen for adsorption on the char surface.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic water oxidation, which provides the electrons necessary for CO₂ reduction and releases O₂ and protons, is performed at the Mn₄CaO₅ cluster in photosystem II (PSII). In this review, studies that assessed the mechanism of water oxidation using infrared spectroscopy are summarized focusing on electron and proton transfer dynamics. Structural changes in proteins and water molecules between intermediates known as Si states (i=0-3) were detected using flash-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. Electron flow in PSII and proton release from substrate water were monitored using the infrared changes in ferricyanide as an exogenous electron acceptor and Mes buffer as a proton acceptor. Time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy provided information on the dynamics of proton-coupled electron transfer during the S-state transitions. In particular, a drastic proton movement during the lag phase ({\~{}}200$\mu$s) before electron transfer in the S3→S0 transition was detected directly by monitoring the infrared absorption of a polarizable proton in a hydrogen bond network. Furthermore, the proton release pathways in the PSII proteins were analyzed by FTIR difference measurements in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, isotopic substitutions, and quantum chemical calculations. Therefore, infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation.

  abstract = {Microwave driven dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a process in which the large polarization present in an electron spin reservoir is transferred to nuclei, thereby enhancing NMR signal intensities. In solid dielectrics there are three mechanisms that mediate this transfer--the solid effect (SE), the cross effect (CE), and thermal mixing (TM). Historically these mechanisms have been discussed theoretically using thermodynamic parameters and average spin interactions. However, the SE and the CE can also be modeled quantum mechanically with a system consisting of a small number of spins and the results provide a foundation for the calculations involving TM. In the case of the SE, a single electron-nuclear spin pair is sufficient to explain the polarization mechanism, while the CE requires participation of two electrons and a nuclear spin, and can be used to understand the improved DNP enhancements observed using biradical polarizing agents. Calculations establish the relations among the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequencies and the microwave irradiation frequency that must be satisfied for polarization transfer via the SE or the CE. In particular, if $\delta$, $\Delta$ {\textless} $\omega$(0I), where $\delta$ and $\Delta$ are the homogeneous linewidth and inhomogeneous breadth of the EPR spectrum, respectively, we verify that the SE occurs when $\omega$(M) = $\omega$(0S) ± $\omega$(0I), where $\omega$(M), $\omega$(0S) and $\omega$(0I) are, respectively, the microwave, and the EPR and NMR frequencies. Alternatively, when $\Delta$ {\textgreater} $\omega$(0I) {\textgreater} $\delta$, the CE dominates the polarization transfer. This two-electron process is optimized when $\omega$(0S(1))-$\omega$(0S(2)) = $\omega$(0I) and $\omega$(M){\~{}}$\omega$(0S(1)) or $\omega$(0S(2)), where $\omega$(0S(1)) and $\omega$(0S(2)) are the EPR Larmor frequencies of the two electrons. Using these matching conditions, we calculate the evolution of the density operator from electron Zeeman order to nuclear Zeeman order for both the SE and the CE. The results provide insights into the influence of the microwave irradiation field, the external magnetic field, and the electron-electron and electron-nuclear interactions on DNP enhancements.},

Subband decompositions of natural images have significantly non-Gaussian higher-order point statistics; these statistics capture image properties that elude Fourier-based techniques. We develop a Bayesian estimator that is a natural extension of the Wiener solution, and that exploits these higher-order statistics. The resulting nonlinear estimator performs a “coring” operation. We provide a simple model for the subband statistics, and use it to develop a semi-blind noise removal algorithm based on a steerable wavelet pyramid},

Under these conditions the water proton relaxation rate is determined by the magnetic coupling between the water protons and the paramagnetic nitroxide fixed on the phospholipid. This coupling is made time-dependent by the relative translational motion of the water proton spins past the nitroxide radical. Using theories developed by Freed and others, we interpret the NMR relaxation data in terms of localized water translational motion and find that the translational diffusion constant for water within approximately 10 A of the phospholipid surface is 6 x 10(-10) m2 s(-1) at 298 K. Similar results are obtained for three different nitroxide labels positioned at different points on the lipid. The diffusion is a thermally activated process with an activation energy only slightly higher than that for bulk water.},

  abstract = {Despite increased attention, little is known about how the crowded intracellular environment affects basic phenomena like protein diffusion. Here, we use NMR to quantify the rotational and translational diffusion of a 7.4-kDa test protein, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), in solutions of glycerol, synthetic polymers, proteins, and cell lysates. As expected, translational diffusion and rotational diffusion decrease with increasing viscosity. In glycerol, for example, the decrease follows the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye laws. Synthetic polymers cause negative deviation from the Stokes laws and affect translation more than rotation. Surprisingly, however, protein crowders have the opposite effect, causing positive deviation and reducing rotational diffusion more than translational diffusion. Indeed, bulk proteins severely attenuate the rotational diffusion of CI2 in crowded protein solutions. Similarly, CI2 diffusion in cell lysates is comparable to its diffusion in crowded protein solutions, supporting the biological relevance of the results. The rotational attenuation is independent of the size and total charge of the crowding protein, suggesting that the effect is general. The difference between the behavior of synthetic polymers and protein crowders suggests that synthetic polymers may not be suitable mimics of the intracellular environment. NMR relaxation data reveal that the source of the difference between synthetic polymers and proteins is the presence of weak interactions between the proteins and CI2. In summary, weak but nonspecific, noncovalent chemical interactions between proteins appear to fundamentally impact protein diffusion in cells.},

This approach could be very useful for targeting Ras and other challenging drug targets.},

However, electrode polarization due to ion gradient formation and noise from solution conductance limited early dielectric spectroscopic measurements to high frequencies only, which in turn limited their sensitivity to biomolecular interactions, as the applied excitation signals were too fast for the charged macromolecules to respond. To minimize electrode polarization effects, capacitive sensors with 20 nm electrode separation were fabricated using silicon dioxide sacrificial layer techniques. The nanoscale separation of the capacitive electrodes in the sensor results in an enhanced overlapping of electrical double layers, and apparently a more ordered "ice-like" water structure. Such effects in turn reduce low frequency contributions from bulk sample resistance and from electrode polarization, and thus markedly enhance sensitivity toward biomolecular interactions. Using these nanogap capacitive sensors, highly sensitive, label-free aptamer-based detection of protein molecules is achieved.},

We demonstrate that covalently bonded organic cages can assemble into crystalline microporous materials. The porosity is prefabricated and intrinsic to the molecular cage structure, as opposed to being formed by non-covalent self-assembly of non-porous sub-units. The three-dimensional connectivity between the cage windows is controlled by varying the chemical functionality such that either non-porous or permanently porous assemblies can be produced. Surface areas and gas uptakes for the latter exceed comparable molecular solids. One of the cages can be converted by recrystallization to produce either porous or non-porous polymorphs with apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of 550 and 23 m2 g(-1), respectively. These results suggest design principles for responsive porous organic solids and for the modular construction of extended materials from prefabricated molecular pores.},

Allosteric inhibition is desirable as it offers several advantages over competitive inhibition, but the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we show that allosteric inhibition can be effected by destabilizing a low-populated conformational state that serves as an on-pathway intermediate for ligand binding, without altering the protein's ground-state structure. As standard structural approaches are typically concerned with changes in the ground-state structure of proteins, the presence of such a mechanism can go easily undetected. Our data strongly argue for the routine use of NMR tools suited to detect and characterize transiently formed conformational states in allosteric systems. Structure information on such important intermediates can ultimately result in more efficient design of allosteric inhibitors.},

  abstract = {EPR spectra of aqueous solutions of the singly charged surfactant nitroxide 4-[N,N-dimethyl-N-(n-dodecyl)ammonium]-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-N-oxy bromide-d16 (DCAT12) are studied as functions of the molar concentration, c = 0.1-8 mM, and the temperature from 273 to 353 K. This concentration range is below the critical micelle concentration, cmc, at which DCAT12 forms micelles. Spin-spin broadening of the EPR lines averaged over the three lines is separated into contributions due to spin exchange, $\backslash$langle{\{}{\}}Be$\backslash$rangle, and dipolar, $\backslash$langle{\{}{\}}Bdip$\backslash$rangle, interactions yielding values of the fractional broadening by spin exchange, {\$}\Omega{\$}(T), that vary from near unity at 353 K to approximately 50{\%} at 273 K. This compares with a variation from unity to approximately 77{\%} for a neutral spin probe perdeuterated 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-oxopiperidine-1-oxyl (PDT) over the same range. Unlike PDT and the Stokes-Einstein prediction, the broadening constant by spin exchange, d$\backslash$langle{\{}{\}}Be$\backslash$rangle/dc, is not linear with T/{\$}\eta{\$}, where {\$}\eta{\$} is the shear viscosity, instead following a quadratic dependence. Nevertheless, d$\backslash$langle{\{}{\}}Be$\backslash$rangle/dc is remarkably close to a hydrodynamic prediction using the Stokes-Einstein equation modified to take the spin probe charge into account. Compared with PDT, values of d$\backslash$langle{\{}{\}}Be$\backslash$rangle/dc are decreased and d$\backslash$langle{\{}{\}}Bdip$\backslash$rangle/dc increased at all temperatures, while the values of the re-encounter rate, {\$}\tau{\$}RE-1, deduced from line shifts, are reduced. Interestingly, values of d$\backslash$langle{\{}{\}}Bdip$\backslash$rangle/dc, {\$}\Omega{\$}(T), and {\$}\tau{\$}RE-1 are comparable for PDT and DCAT12 when compared at the same rotational diffusion rates.},

A comparison with the primary dynamics of native PR and D85N mutant of bacteriorhodopsin is given. Upon photoexcitation of the covalently bound all-trans retinal the excited state decays biexponentially with time constants of 1.4 and 20 ps via a conical intersection, resulting in a 13-cis isomerized retinal. Neither of the two-deactivation channels is significantly preferred. The dynamics is slowed down in comparison with native PR at pH 9 and reaction rates are even lower than for native PR at pH 6, where the primary proton acceptor (Asp97) is protonated. Therefore, the ultrafast isomerization is not only controlled by the charge distribution within the retinal binding pocket. This study shows that in addition to direct electrostatics other effects have to be taken into account to explain the catalytic function of Asp97 in PR on the ultrafast isomerization reaction. This may include sterical interactions and/or bound water molecules within the retinal binding pocket.},

A removable tuning/matching circuit that allows the solenoid to be tuned to the 19F frequency (2.346 MHz, FEDRI) or the 1H frequency (2.494 MHz, PEDRI) without removing the sample was built and tested. Switching of the solenoid between the 19F and 1H frequency is thus achieved in less than 1 min. The co-registered FC-FEDRI and FC-PEDRI images show higher enhancement in the sample regions with higher free radical concn.

Consequently, water near these surfaces is sensitive to subtle changes in surface conformation, topology, and chemistry, any of which can tip the balance toward or away from the wet state and thus significantly alter biomolecular interactions and function. Our work also resolves the long-standing puzzle of why some biological surfaces dewet and other seemingly similar surfaces do not.},

  abstract = {The use of a polychromatic microwave pulse to expand the pumping bandwidth in pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) was investigated. The pumping pulse was applied in resonance with the broad (∼100 mT) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal of the manganese cluster of photosystem II in the S2 state. The observation pulses were in resonance with the narrow EPR signal of the tyrosine radical, YD{\textperiodcentered}. It was found that in the case of the polychromatic pumping pulse containing five harmonics with the microwave frequencies between 8.5 and 10.5 GHz the PELDOR effect corresponding to the dipole interaction between the Mn cluster and YD{\textperiodcentered} was about 2.9 times larger than that achieved with a monochromatic pulse. In addition to the dipolar modulation, the nuclear modulation effects were observed. The effects could be suppressed by averaging the PELDOR trace over the time interval between the observation microwave pulses. The polychromatic excitation technique described will be useful for improving the PELDOR sensitivity in the measurements of long distances in biological samples, where the pair consists of a radical with a narrow EPR spectrum and slow phase relaxation, and a metal center that has a broad EPR spectrum and a short phase relaxation time.},

Under an argon atmosphere, analysis of the exponential saturation recovery curves gives the spin-lattice relaxation rates of the nitroxides, which depend on the nitroxide side-chain dynamics. In the presence of the fast-relaxing paramagnetic reagents O(2) or NiEDDA, global analysis of the saturation recovery provides the spin-lattice relaxation rates as well as the Heisenberg exchange rates of the nitroxide with the reagents. As previously shown with power saturation methods, such exchange rates are direct measures of the solvent accessibility of the nitroxide side chains in the protein structure. The periodic dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rates and the exchange rates along the 128-135 sequence reveal the presence of the helical structure, demonstrating the use of these parameters in structure determination. In general, multiple exponentials are required to fit the saturation recovery data, thus identifying multiple states of the side chain. In one case, multiple conformations detected in the spectrum are not evident in the saturation recovery, suggesting rapid exchange on the timescale of spin-lattice relaxation.},

Normally, in most organic radical solutions the dynamic enhancements of solvent proton resonances decay with increasing field and decreasing temperature due to the dipole-dipole intermolecular interactions, modulated by translational diffusion of individual molecules. In contrast to free radical, a strong solvation effect has been discovered in paramagnetic Cr5+ compounds. Drastic departures from the usual DNP behaviour have been observed. An explanation of the observed effects is proposed by considering the occurrence of hydrogen-bridged solvates. The important motional mechanism that modulates the proton-electron interaction switches from translation to rotation of the complex molecules. A new type of pulse double resonance equipment is used.},

  abstract = {Protein quality control (PQC) degradation protects the cell by preventing the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins. In eukaryotes, PQC degradation is primarily achieved by ubiquitin ligases that attach ubiquitin to misfolded proteins for proteasome degradation. To function effectively, PQC ubiquitin ligases must distinguish misfolded proteins from their normal counterparts by recognizing an attribute of structural abnormality commonly shared among misfolded proteins. However, the nature of the structurally abnormal feature recognized by most PQC ubiquitin ligases is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the yeast nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligase San1 recognizes exposed hydrophobicity in its substrates. San1 recognition is triggered by exposure of as few as five contiguous hydrophobic residues, which defines the minimum window of hydrophobicity required for San1 targeting. We also find that the exposed hydrophobicity recognized by San1 can cause aggregation and cellular toxicity, underscoring the fundamental protective role for San1-mediated PQC degradation of misfolded nuclear proteins.},

abstract = {Wavelet threshold estimators for data with stationary correlated noise are constructed by applying a level-dependent soft threshold to the coefficients in the wavelet transform. A variety of threshold choices is proposed, including one based on an unbiased estimate of mean-squared error. The practical performance of the method is demonstrated on examples, including data from a neurophysiological context. The theoretical properties of the estimators are investigated by comparing them with an ideal but unattainable `benchmark', that can be considered in the wavelet context as the risk obtained by ideal spatial adaptivity, and more generally is obtained by the use of an `oracle' that provides information that is not actually available in the data. It is shown that the level-dependent threshold estimator performs well relative to the bench-mark risk, and that its minimax behaviour cannot be improved on in order of magnitude by any other estimator. The wavelet domain structure of both short- and long-range dependent noise is considered, and in both cases it is shown that the estimators have near optimal behaviour simultaneously in a wide range of function classes, adapting automatically to the regularity properties of the underlying model. The proofs of the main results are obtained by considering a more general multivariate normal decision theoretic problem.},

We report a 12-mer peptide, capsid assembly inhibitor (CAI), that binds the capsid (CA) domain of Gag and inhibits assembly of immature- and mature-like capsid particles in vitro. CAI was identified by phage display screening among a group of peptides with similar sequences that bind to a single reactive site in CA. Its binding site was mapped to CA residues 169-191, with an additional contribution from the last helix of CA. This result was confirmed by a separate X-ray structure analysis showing that CAI inserts into a conserved hydrophobic groove and alters the CA dimer interface. The CAI binding site is a new target for antiviral development, and CAI is the first known inhibitor directed against assembly of immature HIV-1.},

However the electro-chemical free energy of solvation of ions resides largely in the first two water layers, which control the interfacial behavior of the ions and require explicit modeling to capture their distinctive behaviors. The resulting short range forces produce such surprising charge density-dependent behaviors as ion adsorption onto nonpolar surfaces, like charge aggregation of ions, and substantial ion pairing preferences, which arise largely from the affinity of specific ions for individual water molecules. Specific ion effects controlled by the local water affinity of the ion show a diagnostic change of sign between strongly hydrated Na(+) and weakly hydrated K(+) and between strongly hydrated F(-) and weakly hydrated Cl(-), in both cases marking the strength of water-water interactions in bulk solution, a critical benchmark missing from continuum electrostatics models.},

For example, qualitative information on local dynamics and solvent accessibility of proteins and nucleic acids has been obtained by this method. However, making quantitative estimates of T1e from CW-EPR spectra have been frustrated by a lack of understanding of the role of T1e (and T2e) in the slow-motion regime. Theoretical simulation of the CW-EPR lineshapes in the slow-motion region under increasing power levels has been used in this work to test whether the saturation technique can produce quantitative estimates of the spin-lattice relaxation rates, A method is presented by which the correct T1e may be extracted from an analysis of the power-saturation rollover curve, regardless of the amount of inhomogeneous broadening or the rates of molecular reorientation. The range of motional correlation times from 10 to 200 ns should be optimal for extracting quantitative estimates of T1e values in spin-labeled biomolecules. The progressive-saturation rollover curve method should find wide application in those areas of biophysics where information on molecular interactions and solvent exposure as well as molecular reorientation rates are desired.},

The distance constraints from both  methods reveal large-scale movement of opposite signs in the  periplasmic and cytoplasmic part of the transporter upon ATP  hydrolysis. LPS induces distinct structural changes that are inhibited  by trapping of the transporter in an ATP post-hydrolysis intermediate.  The formation of this intermediate involves a 33-A distance change  between the two ABCs, which is consistent with a  dimerization-dissociation cycle during transport that leads to their  substantial separation in the absence of nucleotides. Our results  suggest that ATP-powered transport entails LPS sequestering into the  open cytoplasmic chamber prior to its translocation by alternating  access of the chamber, made possible by 10-20-A conformational changes.},

  abstract  = {The coupling of structural fluctuation and the dynamics of associated water molecules of biological macromolecules is vital for various biological activities. Although a number of molecular dynamics (MD) studies on proteins/DNA predicted the importance of such coupling, experimental evidence of variation of hydration dynamics with controlled structural fluctuation even in model macromolecule is sparse and raised controversies in the contemporary literature. Here, we have investigated dynamics of hydration at the surfaces of two similar anionic micelles sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) as model macromolecules using coumarin 500 (C500) as spectroscopic probe with femtosecond to picosecond time resolution up to 20 ns time window. The constituting surfactants SDS and SDBS are structurally similar except one benzene moiety in the SDBS may offer additional rigidity to the SDBS micelles through $\pi$-stacking and added bulkiness. The structural integrity of the micelles in the aqueous medium is confirmed in dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies. A variety of studies including polarization gated fluorescence spectroscopy and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) have been used to confirm differential structural fluctuation of SDS and SDBS micelles. We have also employed femtosecond-resolved F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in order to study binding of a cationic organic ligand ethidium bromide (EtBr) salt at the micellar surfaces. The distance distribution of the donor (C500)-acceptor (EtBr) in the micellar media reveals the manifestation of the structural flexibility of the micelles. Our studies on dynamical coupling of the structural flexibility with surface hydration in the nanoscopic micellar media may find the relevance in the "master-slave" type water dynamics in biologically relevant macromolecules.},

  abstract = {Singlet molecular oxygen, O(2)(a(1)$\Delta$(g)), can influence many processes pertinent to the function of biological systems, including events that result in cell death. Many of these processes involve a reaction between singlet oxygen and a given amino acid in a protein. As a result, the behavior of that protein can change, either because of a structural alteration and/or a direct modification of an active site. Surprisingly, however, little is known about rate constants for reactions between singlet oxygen and amino acids when the latter are in a protein. In this report, we demonstrate using five separate proteins, each containing only a single tryptophan residue, that the rate constant for singlet oxygen reaction with tryptophan depends significantly on the position of this amino acid in the protein. Most importantly, the reaction rate constant depends not only on the accessibility of the tryptophan residue to oxygen, but also on factors that characterize the local molecular environment of the tryptophan in the protein. The fact that the local protein environment can either appreciably inhibit or accelerate the reaction of singlet oxygen with a given amino acid can have significant ramifications for singlet-oxygen-mediated events that perturb cell function.},

  abstract = {We report the development of a simple ferroelectric cavity insert that increases the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) sensitivity by an order of magnitude when a sample is placed within it. The insert is a hollow cylinder (length 4.8 mm, outside diameter 1.7 mm, inside diameter 0.6 mm) made from a single crystal of KTaO(3), which has a dielectric constant of 230 at X-band (9.5 GHz). Its outside dimensions were chosen to produce a resonant frequency in the X-band range, based on electromagnetic field modeling calculations. The insert increases the microwave magnetic field (H(1)) at the center of the insert by a factor of 7.4 when placed in an X-band TM(110) cavity. This increases the EPR signal for a small (volume 0.13 microL) unsaturated nitroxide spin label sample by a factor of 64 at constant microwave power, and by a factor of 9.8 at constant H(1). The insert does not significantly affect the cavity quality factor Q, indicating that this device simply redistributes the microwave fields within the cavity, focusing H(1) onto the sample inside the insert, thus increasing the filling factor. A similar signal enhancement is obtained in the TM(110) and TE(102) cavities, and when the insert is oriented either vertically (parallel to the microwave field) or horizontally (parallel to the DC magnetic field) in the TM(110) cavity. This order-of-magnitude sensitivity enhancement allows EPR spectroscopy to be performed in conventional high-Q cavities on small EPR samples previously only measurable in loop-gap or dielectric resonators. This is of particular importance for small samples of spin-labeled biomolecules.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic nuclear polarization is emerging as a potential tool to increase the sensitivity of NMR aiming at the detection of macromolecules in liquid solution. One possibility for such an experimental design is to perform the polarization step between electrons and nuclei at low magnetic fields and then transfer the sample to a higher field for NMR detection. In this case, an independent optimization of the polarizer and detection set ups is required. In the present paper we describe the optimization of a polarizer set up at 15 MHz (1)H NMR/9.7 GHz EPR frequencies based on commercial hardware. The sample consists of the nitroxide radical TEMPONE-D,(15)N in water, for which the dimensions were systematically decreased to fit the homogeneous B(1) region of a dielectric ENDOR resonator. With an available B(1) microwave field up to 13 G we observe a maximum DNP enhancement of -170 at room temperature by irradiating on either one of the EPR lines. The DNP enhancement was saturated at all polarizer concentrations. Pulsed ELDOR experiments revealed that the saturation level of the two hyperfine lines is such that the DNP enhancements are well consistent with the coupling factors derived from NMRD data. By raising the polarizing field and frequencies 10-fold, i.e. to 140 MHz (1)H/94 GHz EPR, we reach an enhancement of -43 at microwave field strengths (B(1) approximately 5 G). The results are discussed in view of an application for a DNP spectrometer.},

With a 100 nm Ag film, a 220 $\mu$m etch depth in borosilicate glass substrates were produced and by further thickening the Ag to 300 nm, etch depths exceeding 300 $\mu$m were successfully achieved. SEM images show that thinner Ag films are of finer grains, potentially a source for pinholes formation where rapid penetration of HF along the grain boundaries peels off the Ag film from the glass surface. However, the Ag film was found not to react with HF. The process was demonstrated in the fabrication of cavities for integration with other microfluidic devices.},

  abstract  = {We propose using a set of noninvasive multiscale NMR techniques for probing the structure and dynamics of bulk and confined crude oils with and without asphaltene. High-field 1D (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopies evidence the proton species and the amount of asphaltene and give an average chain length for the hydrocarbon aliphatic chains. Two-dimensional (1)H diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) spectra allow us to identify two populations of hydrocarbons characterized by two distributions of translational diffusion coefficients in the presence of asphaltene and a single one without asphaltene. A detailed analysis of the distributions of longitudinal, T1, relaxation times measured at different magnetic fields is proposed in terms of highly skewed bimodal (or monomodal) log-normal distributions, confirming the two environments in the presence of asphaltene and a single one without asphaltene. We show that these distributions are similar to the gas and gel permeation chromatography distributions, thus showing a connection of the hydrocarbon dynamics with their chain lengths. The remarkable observed features of the nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) profiles of {\textless}1/T1{\textgreater} for bulk and confined crude oils with and without asphaltene are interpreted with an original relaxation model of intermittent surface dynamics of proton species at the proximity of asphaltene nanoaggregates and bulk dynamics in between clusters of these nanoaggregates. This allows us to probe the 2D translational diffusion correlation time and the time of residence of hydrocarbons in the proximity of the asphaltene nanoaggregates. Provided that the diffusion of the hydrocarbons close to the asphaltene nanoaggregates is three times smaller than the bulk diffusion, as the DOSY experiments show, this time of residence gives an average radius of exploration for the 2D hydrocarbon diffusion, r2D ≈ 3.9 nm, of the same order of magnitude as the aggregate sizes found by J. Eyssautier with SAXS and SANS in asphaltene solutions and by O. C. Mullins with the observation of gravitational gradients of asphaltenes in oilfield reservoirs.},

We show that at fields of 0.35 T under ambient conditions and at X-band frequencies, 1H enhancements of {\textgreater}100-fold can be achieved using nitroxide radical systems, which is near the theoretical maximum for 1H polarization using the Overhauser effect at this field. These large enhancements were obtained using a custom built microwave transmitter and a commercial TE102 X-band resonant cavity. The custom built microwave transmitter is compact, so when combined with a permanent magnet it is readily transportable. Our commercial X-band resonator was modified to be tunable over a range of approximately 9.5-10 GHz, giving added versatility to our fixed field portable DNP system. In addition, a field adjustable Halbach permanent magnet has also been employed as another means for matching the electron spin resonance condition. Both portable setups provide large signal enhancements and with improvements in design and engineering, greater than 100-fold 1H enhancements are feasible.},

Subsequent developments allowed the investigation of larger proteins, the initial application of automated analysis routines, and substantial improvements in structural resolution. The application of these methods has enabled the investigation of amyloid fibril structures, conformational dynamics, and their assembly pathways at an atomic level for the first time, as these are systems not accessible by other common techniques. Recent advances and future trends for protein structure determination using MAS SSNMR, as well as its application to the study of amyloid fibrils, are reviewed.},

  abstract = {We describe the model dynamical behavior of the solvent between two nanoscopic hydrophobic solutes. The dynamics of the vicinal water in various sized traps is found to be significantly different from bulk behavior. We consider the dynamics at normal temperature and pressure at three intersolute distances corresponding to the three solvent separated minima in the free energy profile between the solutes with attractions. These three states correspond to one, two, and three intervening layers of water molecules. Results are obtained from a molecular dynamics simulation at constant temperature and pressure (NPT) ensemble. Translational diffusion of water molecules trapped between the two solutes has been analyzed from the velocity correlation function as well as from the mean square displacement of the water molecules. The rotational behavior has been analyzed through the reorientational dynamics of the dipole moment vector of the water molecule by calculating both first and second rank dipole-dipole correlation functions. Both the translational and reorientational mobilities of water are found to be much slower at the smaller separation and increases as the separation between solutes becomes larger. The occupation time distribution functions calculated from the trajectories also show that the relaxation is much slower for the smallest intersolute separation as compared to other wider separations. The sublinear trend in mean square displacement and the stretched exponential decay of the relaxation of dipolar correlation and occupation distribution function indicate that the dynamical behavior of water in the confined region between two large hydrophobic solutes departs from usual Brownian behavior. This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of water in the vicinity of protein surface clefts or trapped between two domains of a protein.},

  abstract = {The stabilization of proteins by a variety of co-solvents can be related to their property of increasing the surface tension of water. It is demonstrated that, during the thermal unfolding of proteins, this increase of the surface tension can be overcome by the increase in the temperature of the solution at the midpoint of the transition, Tm, and the weak binding of co-solvent molecules. Three such co-solvents were studied: trehalose, lysine hydrochloride (LysHCl), and arginine hydrochloride (ArgHCl). Trehalose and LysHCl increase the midpoint of Tm. The increase of the surface tension by addition of trehalose is completely compensated by its decrease due to the increase in Tm. However, for LysHCl, the increase of the surface tension by the co-solvent is partly reduced by its binding to the protein. For trehalose, preferential interaction measurements with RNaseA demonstrate that it is totally excluded from the protein. In contrast, LysHCl gives evidence of binding to RNaseA. ArgHCl also increases the surface tension of water. Nevertheless, Tm of RNaseA decreases on addition of ArgHCl to the solution. Preferential interaction measurements showed very small values of preferential hydration of the native protein, indicating extensive binding of ArgHCl to the protein. During unfolding, the amount of additional ArgHCl binding is sufficiently large to counteract the surface tension effects, and the protein is destabilized. Therefore, although surface tension appears to be a critical factor in the stabilization of proteins, its increase by co-solvent does not ensure increased stabilization. The binding of ligands can reduce significantly, or even overwhelm, its effects.},

  abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease plays a fundamental role in the maturation and life cycle of the retrovirus HIV-1, as it functions in regulating post-translational processing of the viral polyproteins gag and gag-pol; thus, it is a key target of AIDS antiviral therapy. Accessibility of substrate to the active site is mediated by two flaps, which must undergo a large conformational change from an open to a closed conformation during substrate binding and catalysis. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) method of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) with double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the conformations of the flaps in apo HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR), subtypes B, C, and F, CRF01{\_}A/E, and patient isolates V6 and MDR 769. The distance distribution profiles obtained from analysis of the dipolar modulated echo curves were reconstructed to yield a set of Gaussian-shaped populations, which provide an analysis of the flap conformations sampled. The relative percentages of each conformer population described as "tucked/curled", "closed", "semi-open", and "wide-open" were determined and compared for various constructs. The results and analyses show that sequence variations among subtypes, CRFs, and patient isolates of apo HIV-1PR alter the average flap conformation in a way that can be understood as inducing shifts in the relative populations, or conformational sampling, of the previously described four conformations for HIV-1PR.},

However, in the milieu of the cell, the energy landscape can be modulated in space and time by fluctuations in the intracellular environment such as cytoskeletal rearrangements, changes in biomolecule concentrations, and large scale cellular reorganization. We studied the time dependence of the folding landscape of a FRET-labeled enzyme, yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK-FRET). Living U2OS cells served as our test tube, and the mammalian cell cycle, a process strictly regulated in time, served as our clock. We found that both the rate of folding and the thermodynamic stability of PGK-FRET are cell cycle-dependent. We also assayed folding rates of PGK-FRET in spatial proximity to and far away from mitotic chromosomes. Our results show that expedited folding in DNA-rich regions cannot account for the faster rate of PGK-FRET folding in mitotic cells.},

For example, the well known stabilizing osmolyte, trehalose destabilizes some proteins at high concentration and/or high pH. In spite of the fact that destabilizing aspects of osmolytes can modulate many cellular processes including regulation of protein homeostasis (proteostasis), protein-protein interaction, and protein-DNA interaction, researchers have mostly focused on the stabilizing aspects of osmolytes. Thus, it is important to look into both aspects of osmolytes to determine their precise role under physiological conditions. In this article, we have discussed both stabilizing and destabilizing/denaturant aspects of osmolytes to uncover both sides of the coin.},

Many of these processes are intimately controlled by ubiquitination, a posttranslational modification that directs trafficking decisions related to both the biosynthetic delivery of proteins to the plasma membrane (PM) via the secretory pathway and the removal of proteins from the PM via the endocytic pathway. Ubiquitin modification of integral membrane proteins (or "cargoes") generally acts as a sorting signal, which is recognized, captured, and delivered to a specific cellular destination via specialized trafficking events. By affecting the quality, quantity, and localization of integral membrane proteins in the cell, defects in these processes contribute to human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, circulatory diseases, and various neuropathies. This review summarizes our current understanding of how ubiquitin modification influences cargo trafficking, with a special emphasis on mechanisms of quality control and quality maintenance in the secretory and endocytic pathways.},

Several approaches in literature were evaluated but none of these was found to be capable of phasing NMR spectra with sufficient robustness and high enough accuracy to fully eliminate intervention by a human operator. Step by step, aspects from the process of manual/visual phase correction were translated into mathematical concepts and evaluated. This included area minimization, peak height maximization, negative peak minimization and baseline correction. It was found that not one single approach would lead to acceptable results but that a combination of aspects was required, in line again with the process of manual phase correction. The combination of baseline correction, area minimization and negative area penalization was found to give the desired results. The robustness was found to be 100{\%} which means that the correct zeroth order and first order phasing parameters are returned independent of the position of the starting point of the search in this parameter space. When applied to high signal-to-noise proton spectra, the accuracy was such that the returned phasing parameters were within a distance of 0.1-0.4 degrees in the two dimensional parameter space which resulted in an average error of 0.1{\%} in calculated properties such as copolymer composition and end groups.},

We interpret these well-defined changes in the dielectric properties of the solutions as a result of molecular rearrangements caused by the aggregation process that alter the current circulation pathways and the electric dipole distribution. The fact that these specific changes in the dielectric behavior coincide with critical concentrations where dimer and oligomer formation in pure aqueous MO solutions are known to occur suggests that electrical impedance spectroscopy can be a competitive technique for the investigation of aggregation behavior in dyes and surfactants.},

Solution NMR spectroscopy is potentially a powerful method for characterizing both the structural and temporal aspects of protein hydration but has been plagued by artifacts. Encapsulation of the protein of interest within the aqueous core of a reverse micelle particle results in a general slowing of water dynamics, significant reduction in hydrogen exchange chemistry and elimination of contributions from bulk water thereby enabling the use of nuclear Overhauser effects to quantify interactions between the protein surface and hydration water. Here we extend this approach to allow use of dipolar interactions between hydration water and hydrogens bonded to protein carbon atoms. By manipulating the molecular reorientation time of the reverse micelle particle through use of low viscosity liquid propane, the T(1$\rho$) relaxation time constants of (1)H bonded to (13)C were sufficiently lengthened to allow high quality rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effects to be obtained. These data supplement previous results obtained from dipolar interactions between the protein and hydrogens bonded to nitrogen and in aggregate cover the majority of the molecular surface of the protein. A wide range of hydration dynamics is observed. Clustering of hydration dynamics on the molecular surface is also seen. Regions of long-lived hydration water correspond with regions of the protein that participate in molecular recognition of binding partners suggesting that the contribution of the solvent entropy to the entropy of binding has been maximized through evolution.},

Static structures such as crystals often form through simple energy minimization, whereas dynamic ones require continuous energy input to grow and sustain. Dynamic systems are ubiquitous in nature and biology but have proven challenging to understand and engineer. Here, we bridge the gap from static to dynamic self-assembly by introducing a model system based on ferrofluid droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces. The droplets self-assemble under a static external magnetic field into simple patterns that can be switched to complicated dynamic dissipative structures by applying a time-varying magnetic field. The transition between the static and dynamic patterns involves kinetic trapping and shows complexity that can be directly visualized.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic oxygen evolution takes place in the thylakoid protein complex known as photosystem II. The reaction center core of this photosystem, where photochemistry occurs, is a heterodimer of homologous polypeptides called D1 and D2. Besides chlorophyll and quinone, photosystem II contains other organic cofactors, including two known as Z and D. Z transfers electrons from the site of water oxidation to the oxidized reaction center primary donor, P+.680, while D+. gives rise to the dark-stable EPR spectrum known as signal II. D+. has recently been shown to be a tyrosine radical. Z is probably a second tyrosine located in a similar environment. Indirect evidence indicates that Z and D are associated with the D1 and D2 polypeptides, respectively. To identify the specific tyrosine residue corresponding to D, we have changed Tyr-160 of the D2 polypeptide to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis of a psbD gene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. The resulting mutant grows photosynthetically, but it lacks the EPR signal of D+.. We conclude that D is Tyr-160 of the D2 polypeptide. We suggest that the C2 symmetry in photosystem II extends beyond P680 to its immediate electron donor and conclude that Z is Tyr-161 of the D1 polypeptide.},

Two new directions in TOAC research are described. The first investigates intermediates formed during -helix unfolding. Double TOAC labeled -helical peptides were unfolded at low temperature in aqueous solution with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. Comparison of ESR spectra from two doubly labeled peptides suggests that 310-helix emerges as an intermediate. The second research direction involves the use of high frequency ESR (140 GHz) at low temperature to assess dipolar couplings and, hence, distances between TOAC pairs in a series of 310-helical peptides. Preliminary simulations suggest that high frequency ESR is able to extract correct distances between 6 and 11 {\AA}. In addition, the spectra appear to be very sensitive to the relative orientation of the TOAC labels. {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc. Biopolymers (Pept Sci) 55: 479-485, 2000},

The R1($\omega$) NMRD profiles were recorded over a frequency range from 0.01 MHz to 40 MHz for both intact and Mn-depleted photosystem II core complexes from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (T. vulcanus). The intact-minus-(Mn)-depleted difference NMRD profiles show a characteristic dispersion from approximately 0.03 MHz to 1 MHz, which is interpreted on the basis of the Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan (SBM) and the slow motion theories as being due to a paramagnetic enhanced relaxation (PRE) of water protons. Both theories are qualitatively consistent with the ST = 1, g = 4.9 paramagnetic state previously described for the S1 state of the OEC; however, an alternative explanation involving the loss of a separate class of long-lived internal waters due to the Mn-depletion procedure can presently not be ruled out. Using a point-dipole approximation the PRE-NMRD effect can be described as being caused by 1-2 water molecules that are located about 10 {\AA} away from the spin center of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the OEC. The application of the SBM theory to the dispersion observed for PSII in the S1 state is questionable, because the parameters extracted do not fulfil the presupposed perturbation criterion. In contrast, the slow motion theory gives a consistent picture indicating that the water molecules are in fast chemical exchange with the bulk ($\tau$w {\textless} 1 $\mu$s). The modulation of the zero-field splitting (ZFS) interaction suggests a (restricted) reorientation/structural equilibrium of the Mn4CaO5 cluster with a characteristic time constant of $\tau$ZFS = 0.6-0.9 $\mu$s.},

By monitoring the self-diffusion behavior of water, the technique yields an estimate of the homogeneous length scale $\lambda$(hom), i.e. the maximum length scale at which there is local structural heterogeneity in a globally homogeneous material. A cross-over between local non-Gaussian to global Gaussian diffusion is observed by varying the experimentally defined length- and time-scales. Occasional observation of a weak Bragg peak in the PGSE signal attenuation curves permits the direct estimation of the MLV radius in favorable cases, thus yielding the constant of proportionality between $\lambda$(hom) and radius. The microstructural origin of the Bragg peak is verified through Brownian dynamics simulations and a theoretical analysis based on the center-of-mass diffusion propagator. $\lambda$(hom) is decreasing with increasing shear rate in agreement with theoretical expectations and results from (2)H NMR lineshape analysis.},

X-band continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW EPR) and pulse X- and Q-band 15N electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques were employed. To avoid microwave saturation at low temperatures in CW EPR studies, a holmium complex Ho(Dbm)3Bpy (where Dbm is dibenzoylmethane and Bpy is 2,2$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}'{\}}-bipyridine) was added. X- and Q-band 15N-ENDOR data have shown that the nitroxide hfi tensor is axially symmetric. The combination of data from all techniques allowed us to obtain the temperature dependence of isotropic and anisotropic parts of the nitroxide hfi tensor. Above {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}100 K, a linear dependence of the anisotropic hfi value was observed, whereas below 30 K it was found to be nearly temperature independent. Such a behavior can be interpreted using the model of restricted orientational motions (librations) of a spin probe in a glassy matrix, with quantum effects occurring at low temperature (``freezing'' of the librations). The energy quantum for the libration motion estimated from the temperature dependence of hfi of the spin probe is 84 cm-1. Low-frequency Raman spectra of 5CB were also obtained, which provided the mean vibrational frequency of 76 cm-1 for glassy 5CB.},

Fluorescence microscopy enables visualization of coexisting lipid phases in giant unilamellar phases, but the composition information is missing. For cholesterol-containing lipid mixtures, knowledge of the compositions of the coexisting phases is important for understanding the nature of "membrane rafts". We propose and demonstrate a new method, based on ESR spectroscopy, for determining tie-lines in regions of two-phase coexistence in a ternary lipid mixture. Over 100 different lipid compositions containing the spin-labeled phospholipid 16-PC in or near the two-phase coexistence region of the liquid-disordered and the gel phases of dipalmitoyl-PC/dilauroyl-PC/cholesterol (DPPC/DLPC/Chol) were studied to determine five tie-lines, spread over virtually the full range of this coexistence region. The method is based on the facts that (1) along a tie-line the ESR spectrum must be a superposition of the two ESR spectra from the respective single phases at the phase boundaries (connected by the tie-line) in a ratio given by the lever rule; (2) along a tie-line the partition coefficient, K(p), for the spin-label, which is also determined in our method, must be constant. We do find that K(p) for 16-PC is close to unity, but its value depends on the particular tie-line. The coexisting phases in equilibrium are characterized by the K(p) of the spin-label and its respective dynamic parameters obtained from fitting the ESR spectra to dynamical models.},

The dependence of the polarization on microwave frequency, radical concentration and electron saturation was studied. For optimized conditions, a (13)C polarization equal to 64+/-5{\%} was obtained, an increase by more than a factor of two compared with earlier results at 3.35 T of the same system. It was furthermore observed that the addition of gadolinium, which resulted in a twofold polarization increase at 3.35 T, only resulted in a minor improvement at 4.64 T. The dependence of the electron saturation on microwave frequency and microwave power was quantified by first moment measurements which were obtained by nucleus-electron double resonance (NEDOR) experiments. Complete electron saturation was observed for a microwave frequency close to the centre frequency of the ESR line, and by using maximum power of the microwave source. The DNP build-up time at 4.64 T (approximately 3000 s) was prolonged by approximately a factor three over the build-up time at 3.35 T (approximately 1200 s). However, after approximately 20 min of microwave irradiation the polarization at 4.64 T exceeded the polarization at 3.35 T.},

In contrast to conventional double-resonance structures, the body of the microwave cavity simultaneously acts as a NMR coil, allowing for increased efficiency of radiofrequency irradiation while maintaining a high quality factor for microwave irradiation. The resonator design is ideal for low-gamma-nuclei ENDOR, where sensitivity is limited by the fact that electron spin relaxation times are on the order of the RF pulse lengths. The performance is demonstrated with H-2 ENDOR on a standard perdeuterated bis-diphenylene-phenyl-allyl stable radical. In DNP experiments, we show that the use of this resonator, combined with a low microwave power setup (17 mW), leads to significantly higher H-1 signal enhancement (epsilon similar to 400 +/- 50) than previously achieved at 5-T fields. The results emphasize the importance of optimizing the microwave B-1 field by improving either the quality factor of the microwave resonator or the microwave power level. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Noise can adversely impact resolution and/or frequency accuracy in FDM spectral estimates. Paradoxically, more complete data can lead to worse FDM spectra if there is appreciable noise. However, by modifying the numerical method, the FDM noise performance improves significantly, without apparently losing any of the existing advantages. The two key modifications are to adjust the FDM basis functions so that matrix elements computed from them have less noise contribution on average, and to regularize each dimension of a multidimensional spectrum independently. The modifications can be recommended for general-purpose use in the case of somewhat noisy, incomplete data.},

Proteins in reverse micelles (RMs) have promise as tools to achieve this objective because the water content can be manipulated. Hemoglobin is an appropriate tool with which to probe hydration effects. We describe both a protocol for hemoglobin encapsulation in reverse micelles and a facile method using PEG and cosolvents to manipulate water content. Hydration properties are probed using the water-sensitive fluorescence from Hb bound pyranine and covalently attached Badan. Protein dynamics are probed through ligand recombination traces derived from photodissociated carbonmonoxy hemoglobin on a log scale that exposes the potential role of both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ solvent fluctuations in modulating protein dynamics. The results open the possibility of probing hydration level phenomena in this system using a combination of NMR and optical probes.},

  abstract = {The structure of dodecylamine (DDA) aggregates acting as templates in the synthesis of mesoporous silica (in the DDA/water/ethanol/TEOS system) was studied via EPR spectra of a variety of spin probes and of a spin-labeled silica precursor. Two recipes have been examd.: one, starting from a water-rich DDA soln., A0, reported to produce a silica with framework mesopores and textural pores comparable in vol., and another, starting from an ethanol-rich soln., B0, which yields a solid having practically only framework pores. For both compns. the relative positions of the spin probes in the aggregates have been detd., the local polarities expressed in terms of the Kosower scale and their motions examd. The aggregates formed have been characterized as emulsion droplets for A0 and micelles with radii {\textless}25 .ANG. for B0. After reaction of A0 and B0 with TEOS, all probes showed significantly hindered motion in the wet ppts. In the solid B, pptd. from the ethanol-rich solvent, the spin probes 5- and 7-doxyl stearic acid (5- and 7-DSA) are strongly immobilized, while other probes maintain quasi-isotropic motion but with very large rotational correlation times. This pattern is characteristic of micelles with hindered tumbling and/or lateral diffusion and is assigned to those aggregates (in interaction with the silica component) on which the framework mesopores are formed. In solid A, pptd. from A0, 5- and 7-DSA spin probes maintain the spectra with anisotropic features, characterized by an order degree found in the starting emulsion, but with evidence of tighter packing, while other probes have their rotation retarded. These aggregates have a low curvature interface, characteristic of emulsion droplets and are assumed to be at the origin of the large textural pores, which characterize this solid. Adsorption of probes after synthesis rather than before pptn. supports these assignments. We have also found that the surfactant-silica interaction is critically dependent on solvent. The strong immobilization of the probes in the interface region, obsd. during drying at low temps., is a reversible process, since under these conditions the silica network crosslinking is only incipient; 29Si NMR data show that crosslinking becomes important only at {\textgreater}90 DegC.

abstract = {A new approach to spectral editing of CPMAS 13C spectra is presented that combines depolarization and polarization inversion of the rare 13C spins. Four different spectra have been obtained in which the intensities of the nonprotonated 13C, 13CH, 13CH2, and 13CH3 groups are affected in a predictable fashion. A proper combination of these spectra yields a 13CH2-only subspectrum, a 13CH-only subspectrum, and a spectrum with 13CH3 and nonprotonated 13C only. If the 13CH3 and quaternary carbons can be distinguished by their chemical shifts, intensity-corrected 13CH3-only and quaternary-13C-only subspectra can also be generated. In this case the individual proton-multiplicity-selected subspectra can be added to yield a synthetic CPMAS spectrum. Differences between the synthetic CPMAS spectra and the corresponding normal CPMAS spectra are found to be quite small for a number of model compounds, indicating that the method is fairly robust. Applications to complex solid mixtures such as whole coals are also presented.},

  abstract  = {Optimal control theory has recently been introduced to nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)spectroscopy as a means to systematically design and optimize pulse sequences for liquid- and solid-state applications. This has so far primarily involved numerical optimization using gradient-based methods, which allow for the optimization of a large number of pulse sequence parameters in a concerted way to maximize the efficiency of transfer between given spin states or shape the nuclear spin Hamiltonian to a particular form, both within a given period of time. Using such tools, a variety of new pulse sequences with improved performance have been developed, and the NMR spin engineers have been challenged to consider alternative routes for analytical experiment design to meet similar performance. In addition, it has lead to increasing demands to the numerical procedures used in the optimization process in terms of computational speed and fast convergence. With the latter aspect in mind, here we introduce an alternative approach to numerical experiment design based on the Krotov formulation of optimal control theory. For practical reasons, the overall radio frequency power delivered to the sample should be minimized to facilitate experimental implementation and avoid excessive sample heating. The presented algorithm makes explicit use of this requirement and iteratively solves the stationary conditions making sure that the maximum of the objective is reached. It is shown that this method is faster per iteration and takes different paths within a control space than gradient-based methods. In the present work, the Krotov approach is demonstrated by the optimization of NMR and dynamic nuclear polarizationexperiments for various spin systems and using different constraints with respect to radio frequency and microwave power consumption.},

Correlation of relaxation time constants, such as T(1) and T(2), conceptually similar to the conventional multidimensional spectroscopy, have been difficult to determine primarily due to the absense of an efficient multidimensional Laplace inversion program. We demonstrate the use of a novel computer algorithm for fast two-dimensional inverse Laplace transformation to obtain T(1)--T(2) correlation functions. The algorithm efficiently performs a least-squares fit on two-dimensional data with a nonnegativity constraint. We use a regularization method to find a balance between the residual fitting errors and the known noise amplitude, thus producing a result that is found to be stable in the presence of noise. This algorithm can be extended to include functional forms other than exponential kernels. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm at different signal-to-noise ratios and with different T(1)--T(2) spectral characteristics using several brine-saturated rock samples.},

  abstract  = {Electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy of phospholipids spin-labeled systematically down the sn-2 chain was used to detect the penetration of water (D2O) into bilayer membranes of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine with and without 50 mol {\%} cholesterol. Three-pulse stimulated echoes allow the resolution of two superimposed 2H-ESEEM spectral components of different widths, for spin labels located in the upper part of the lipid chains. Quantum chemical calculations (DFT) and ESEEM simulations assign the broad spectral component to one or two D2O molecules that are directly hydrogen bonded to the N-O group of the spin label. Classical ESEEM simulations establish that the narrow spectral component arises from nonbonded water (D2O) molecules that are free in the hydrocarbon chain region of the bilayer membrane. The amplitudes of the broad 2H-ESEEM spectral component correlate directly with those of the narrow component for spin labels at different positions down the lipid chain, reflecting the local H-bonding equilibria. The D2O-ESEEM amplitudes decrease with position down the chain toward the bilayer center, displaying a sigmoidal dependence on position that is characteristic of transmembrane polarity profiles established by other less direct spin-labeling methods. The midpoint of the sigmoidal profile is shifted toward the membrane center for membranes without cholesterol, relative to those with cholesterol, and the D2O-ESEEM amplitude in the outer regions of the chain is greater in the presence of cholesterol than in its absence. For both membrane types, the D2O amplitude is almost vanishingly small at the bilayer center. The water-penetration profiles reverse correlate with the lipid-chain packing density, as reflected by 1H-ESEEM intensities from protons of the membrane matrix. An analysis of the H-bonding equilibria provides essential information on the binding of water molecules to H-bond acceptors within the hydrophobic interior of membranes. For membranes containing cholesterol, approximately 40{\%} of the nitroxides in the region adjacent to the lipid headgroups are H bonded to water, of which ca. 15{\%} are doubly H bonded. Corresponding H-bonded populations in membranes without cholesterol are ca. 20{\%}, of which ca. 6{\%} are doubly bonded.},

  abstract = {Molecules undergo non-Brownian diffusion in the plasma membrane, but the mechanism behind this anomalous diffusion is controversial. To characterize the anomalous diffusion in the complex system of the plasma membrane and to understand its underlying mechanism, single-molecule/particle methods that allow researchers to avoid ensemble averaging have turned out to be highly effective. However, the intrinsic problems of time-averaging (resolution) and the frequency of the observations have not been explored. These would not matter for the observations of simple Brownian particles, but they do strongly affect the observation of molecules undergoing anomalous diffusion. We examined these effects on the apparent motion of molecules undergoing simple, totally confined, or hop diffusion, using Monte Carlo simulations of particles undergoing short-term confined diffusion within a compartment and long-term hop diffusion between these compartments, explicitly including the effects of time-averaging during a single frame of the camera (exposure time) and the frequency of observations (frame rate). The intricate relationships of these time-related experimental parameters with the intrinsic diffusion parameters have been clarified, which indicated that by systematically varying the frame time and rate, the anomalous diffusion can be clearly detected and characterized. Based on these results, single-particle tracking of transferrin receptor in the plasma membrane of live PtK2 cells were carried out, varying the frame time between 0.025 and 33 ms (0.03-40 kHz), which revealed the hop diffusion of the receptor between 47-nm (average) compartments with an average residency time of 1.7 ms, with the aid of single fluorescent-molecule video imaging.},

We discuss several aspects of DNP experiments at 9.4 T (400 MHz resonant frequency for (1)H, 264 GHz for electron spins in organic radicals) in the 7-80K temperature range, using a 30 mW, frequency-tunable microwave source and a quasi-optical microwave bridge for polarization control and low-loss microwave transmission. In experiments on frozen glycerol/water doped with nitroxide radicals, DNP signal enhancements up to a factor of 80 are observed (relative to (1)H NMR signals with thermal equilibrium spin polarization). The largest sensitivity enhancements are observed with a new triradical dopant, DOTOPA-TEMPO. Field modulation with a 10 G root-mean-squared amplitude during DNP increases the nuclear spin polarizations by up to 135{\%}. Dependencies of (1)H NMR signal amplitudes, nuclear spin relaxation times, and DNP build-up times on the dopant and its concentration, temperature, microwave power, and modulation frequency are reported and discussed. The benefits of low-temperature DNP can be dramatic: the (1)H spin polarization is increased approximately 1000-fold at 7 K with DNP, relative to thermal polarization at 80K.},

Our particular interest here is in the ability of wavelet transforms to remove backgrounds of spectroscopic signals. We will discuss the case of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for illustration, but the situation it depicts is widespread throughout a myriad of different types of spectroscopies (IR, NMR, etc.). We outline a purpose-built algorithm that we have developed to perform an iterative wavelet transform. In this algorithm, the effect of the signal peaks above the background is reduced after each iteration until the fit converges close to the real background. Experimental examples of two different SERS applications are given: one involving broad backgrounds (that do not vary much among spectra), and another that involves single molecule SERS (SM-SERS) measurements with narrower (and varying) backgrounds. In both cases, we will show that wavelet transforms can be used to fit the background with a great deal of accuracy, thus providing the framework for automatic background removal of large sets of data (typically obtained in time-series or spatial mappings).

The influence of crowding on protein stability arises from two phenomena, hard-core repulsions and soft (i.e., chemical) interactions. Most efforts to understand crowding effects on protein stability, however, focus on hard-core repulsions, which are inherently entropic and stabilizing. We assessed these phenomena by measuring the temperature dependence of NMR-detected amide proton exchange and used these data to extract the entropic and enthalpic contributions of crowding to the stability of ubiquitin. Contrary to expectations, the contribution of chemical interactions is large and in many cases dominates the contribution from hardcore repulsions. Our results show that both chemical interactions and hard-core repulsions must be considered when assessing the effects of crowding and help explain previous observations about protein stability and dynamics in cells.},

  abstract  = {The protein dynamical transition and its connection with the liquid-glass transition (GT) of hydration water and aqueous solvents are reviewed. The protein solvation shell exhibits a regular glass transition, characterized by steps in the specific heat and the thermal expansion coefficient at the calorimetric glass temperature T(G) approximately 170 K. It implies that the time scale of the structural alpha-relaxation has reached the experimental time window of 1-100 s. The protein dynamical transition, identified from elastic neutron scattering experiments by enhanced amplitudes of molecular motions exceeding the vibrational level, probes the alpha-process on a shorter time scale. The corresponding liquid-glass transition occurs at higher temperatures, typically 240 K. The GT is generally associated with diverging viscosities, the freezing of long-range translational diffusion in the supercooled liquid. Due to mutual hydrogen bonding, both, protein- and solvent relaxational degrees of freedom slow down in paralleled near the GT. However, the freezing of protein motions, where surface-coupled rotational and librational degrees of freedom are arrested, is better characterized as a rubber-glass transition. In contrast, internal protein modes such as the rotation of side chains are not affected. Moreover, ligand binding experiments with myoglobin in various glass-forming solvents show, that only ligand entry and exit rates depend on the local viscosity near the protein surface, but protein-internal ligand migration is not coupled to the solvent. The GT leads to structural arrest on a macroscopic scale due to the microscopic cage effect on the scale of the intermolecular distance. Mode coupling theory provides a theoretical framework to understand the microscopic nature of the GT even in complex systems. The role of the alpha- and beta-process in the dynamics of protein hydration water is evaluated. The protein-solvent GT is triggered by hydrogen bond fluctuations, which give rise to fast beta-processes. High-frequency neutron scattering spectra indicate increasing hydrogen bond braking above T(G).},

These changes were tightly correlated with rearrangements at the active site during the formation of productive enzyme-substrate intermediates and were different from those in an enzyme-inhibitor complex. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a steep gradient of fast-to-slow coupled protein-water motions around the protein, active site and substrate. Our results show that water retardation occurs before formation of the functional Michaelis complex.

Stability towards reduction and spectral characteristics of the three new probes were determined in vitro using 290 MHz radiofrequency (RF)- and X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), longitudinally detected EPR (LODEPR), and field-cycled dynamic nuclear polarization (FC-DNP) techniques. The newly synthesized probe, 4-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-pyridine-4-yl-2,5,5-triethyl-2,5-,dihydro-1H-imidazol-oxyl, was found to be the most appropriate for the application in the stomach due to both higher stability and convenient pH sensitivity range from pH 1.8 to 6. LODEPR, FC-DNP and proton-electron double resonance imaging (PEDRI) techniques were used to detect the nitroxide localization and acidity in the rat stomach. Improved probe characteristics allowed us to follow in vivo the drug-induced perturbation in the stomach acidity and its normalization afterwards during I h or longer period of time. The results show the applicability of the techniques for monitoring drug pharmacology and disease in the living animals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As a liquid is cooled far below its melting point, dynamics in some regions of the sample can be orders of magnitude faster than dynamics in other regions only a few nanometers away. In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. In particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise? The answers to these questions influence practical applications of glass-forming materials, including polymers, metallic glasses, and pharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {Targeted therapy with imatinib and other selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors has transformed the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Unlike chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lacks a common genetic aberration amenable to therapeutic targeting. However, our understanding of normal B-cell versus CLL biology points to differences in properties of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling that may be amenable to selective therapeutic targeting. The application of mouse models has further expanded this understanding and provides information about targets in the BCR signaling pathway that may have other important functions in cell development or long-term health. In addition, overexpression or knockout of selected targets offers the potential to validate targets genetically using new mouse models of CLL. The initial success of BCR-targeted therapies has promoted much excitement in the field of CLL. At the present time, GS-1101, which reversibly inhibits PI3K$\delta$, and ibrutinib (PCI-32765), an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, have generated the most promising early results in clinical trials including predominately refractory CLL where durable disease control has been observed. This review provides a summary of BCR signaling, tools for studying this pathway relevant to drug development in CLL, and early progress made with therapeutics targeting BCR-related kinases.},

Relating the features of the observed spectra to the underlying molecular motions and interactions is, however, challenging. To make progress toward a rigorous interpretation of ESR spectra, we perform extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of fully solvated T4 Lysozyme, labeled with the spin label MTSSL at positions 72 and 131. These two sites have been the object of numerous experimental studies and are generally considered as prototypical solvent-exposed sites on the surfaces of alpha-helices. To extend the time window afforded by the MD simulations, stochastic Markov models reflecting the dynamics of the spin label side chains in terms of their rotameric states are constructed from the trajectories. The calculated multifrequency ESR spectra are in very good agreement with experiment for three different magnetic field strengths without adjusting any parameters. During the trajectories, the spin labels interconvert among a fairly large number of conformations and display a propensity to form interactions with protein residues other than their nearest neighbors along the helix. The detailed picture of the spin label emerging from the MD simulations provides useful insight into the molecular origins of the available spectroscopic and crystallographic data.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the feasibility of a perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique that uses Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to provide contrast during the continuous delivery of hyperpolarized water in rats. Materials and Methods: Protocols approved by the local institutional animal care and use committees were followed. Twelve male Wistar rats were anesthetized and prepared by placing injection tubing in the subcutaneous layer (n = 3), peritoneum (n = 3), aorta (n = 3), or carotid artery (n = 3). Water was hyperpolarized by means of Overhauser DNP in the 0.35-T fringe field of a 1.5-T MR imaging magnet by using a custom-built system to continuously deliver radical-free hyperpolarized water to the subject. Fast gradient-echo and spoiled gradient-recalled-echo MR imaging sequences were used. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the images was calculated and compared. Results: Images showed greatly altered SNR and enhanced flow contrast at all injection locations. For subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injections, the water perfusion trajectory was observed for approximately 5 seconds after injection. Flow through a 4.2-cm length of artery was seen during intra-aortic injection. The right hemisphere of the brain was seen during injection into the right carotid artery. Images with hyperpolarized water had greatly altered SNR compared with images without injection or with the injection of nonhyperpolarized water, with a range of 13{\%}-27{\%} for the carotid and 444{\%}-2900{\%} for the other regions. Conclusion: Perfusion contrast for MR imaging can be obtained by continuously infusing hyperpolarized water, providing localized angiography or brain perfusion information in vivo for rat models. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111804/-/DC1.},

abstract = {Advanced MRI techniques, such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion MR imaging can give important in vivo physiological and metabolic information, complementing morphologic findings from conventional MRI in the clinical setting. Combining perfusion MRI and MR spectroscopy can help in patients with brain masses in who the pre-operative differential diagnosis is unclear. This review demonstrates the use of dynamic, susceptibility weighted, contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DSC MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to distinguish surgical from non-surgical lesions in the brain. There is overlap in the MRI appearance of many enhancing and ring-enhancing lesions such as gliomas, metastases, inflammatory lesions, demyelinating lesions, subacute ischemia, abscess and some AIDS related lesions. We review examples of histopathologically confirmed high-grade glioma, a middle cerebral artery territory infarct, a tumefactive demyelinating lesion and a metastasis for which conventional MR imaging (MRI) was non-specific and potentially misleading and demonstrate how DSC MRI and MRSI features were used to increase the specificity of neurodiagnosis. At several institutions, many patients routinely undergo MRI as well as MRSI and DSC MRI. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements are obtained from regions of maximal perfusion as determined from perfusion color overlay maps. Metabolite levels and ratios are determined for Choline (Cho), N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA), Lactate and Lipids (LL). Metabolite levels are obtained by measuring the peak heights of each metabolite and the ratios are obtained from these measurements for Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr. Neurosurgical intervention carries substantial morbidity, mortality, financial and potential emotional cost to the patient and family. Making a pre-operative diagnosis allows the neurosurgeon to be confident in the choice of treatment plan for the patient and allays considerable patient anxiety. The utility of combining clinical findings with multi-parametric information from perfusion and spectroscopic MR imaging in differentiating surgical lesions from those which do not require surgical intervention is discussed.

Studies of protease dynamics suggest that the rearrangement of the hydrophobic core is essential for enzyme activity. Many mutations in the hydrophobic core are also associated with drug resistance and may modulate the core flexibility. To test the role of flexibility in protease activity, pairs of cysteines were introduced at the interfaces of flexible regions remote from the active site. Disulfide bond formation was confirmed by crystal structures and by alkylation of free cysteines and mass spectrometry. Oxidized and reduced crystal structures of these variants show the overall structure of the protease is retained. However, cross-linking the cysteines led to drastic loss in enzyme activity, which was regained upon reducing the disulfide cross-links. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that altered dynamics propagated throughout the enzyme from the engineered disulfide. Thus, altered flexibility within the hydrophobic core can modulate HIV-1 protease activity, supporting the hypothesis that drug resistant mutations distal from the active site can alter the balance between substrate turnover and inhibitor binding by modulating enzyme activity.},

The HIV gp41 fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion, adopts either an $\alpha$-helical or $\beta$-sheeted structure depending on the cholesterol concentration. We used phosphocholine spin labels on the lipid headgroup and different positions on the acyl chain to detect its perturbation on lipid bilayers containing different cholesterol concentrations by electron-spin resonance. Our findings were as follows. 1), gp41 FP affects the lipid order in the same manner as previously shown for influenza hemagglutinin FP, i.e., it has a cooperative effect versus the peptide/lipid ratio, supporting our hypothesis that membrane ordering is a common prerequisite for viral membrane fusion. 2), gp41 FP induces membrane ordering in all lipid compositions studied, whereas a nonfusion mutant FP perturbs lipid order to a significantly smaller extent. 3), In high-cholesterol-containing lipid bilayers, where gp41 FP is in the $\beta$-aggregation conformation, its effect on the lipid ordering reaches deeper into the bilayer. The different extent to which the two conformers perturb is correlated with their fusogenicity. The possible role of the two conformers in membrane fusion is discussed.},

The notion that molecules rearrange cooperatively has long been postulated to explain diverging relaxation times and broadened (non-exponential) response functions near the glass transition. Recently, cooperativity was observed and analysed in colloid glasses and in simulations of binary liquids well above the glass transition. But nanometre-scale studies of cooperativity at the molecular glass transition are lacking. Important issues to be resolved include the precise form of the cooperativity and its length scale, and whether the broadened response is intrinsic to individual cooperative regions, or arises only from heterogeneity in an ensemble of such regions. Here we describe direct observations of molecular cooperativity near the glass transition in polyvinylacetate (PVAc), using nanometre-scale probing of dielectric fluctuations. Molecular clusters switched spontaneously among two to four distinct configurations, producing random telegraph noise. Our analysis of these noise signals and their power spectra reveals that individual clusters exhibit transient dynamical heterogeneity and non-exponential kinetics.},

  abstract = {A technique has been developed for proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of perfusion, using water as a freely diffusable tracer, and its application to the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rat is demonstrated. The method involves labeling the inflowing water proton spins in the arterial blood by inverting them continuously at the neck region and observing the effects of inversion on the intensity of brain MRI. Solution to the Bloch equations, modified to include the effects of flow, allows regional perfusion rates to be measured from an image with spin inversion, a control image, and a T1 image. Continuous spin inversion labeling the arterial blood water was accomplished, using principles of adiabatic fast passage by applying continuous-wave radiofrequency power in the presence of a magnetic field gradient in the direction of arterial flow. In the detection slice used to measure perfusion, whole brain CBF averaged 1.39 +/- 0.19 ml.g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SEM, n = 5). The technique's sensitivity to changes in CBF was measured by using graded hypercarbia, a condition that is known to increase brain perfusion. CBF vs. pCO2 data yield a best-fit straight line described by CBF (ml.g-1.min-1) = 0.052pCO2 (mm Hg) - 0.173, in excellent agreement with values in the literature. Finally, perfusion images of a freeze-injured rat brain have been obtained, demonstrating the technique's ability to detect regional abnormalities in perfusion. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  abstract = {A Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (DNP) enhanced solid-state Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR spectrometer operating at 6.7 T is described and demonstrated. The 187 GHz TE(13) fundamental mode of the FU CW VII gyrotron is used as the microwave source for this magnetic field strength and 284 MHz (1)H DNP-NMR. The spectrometer is designed for use with microwave frequencies up to 395 GHz (the TE(16) second-harmonic mode of the gyrotron) for DNP at 14.1T (600 MHz (1)H NMR). The pulsed microwave output from the gyrotron is converted to a quasi-optical Gaussian beam using a Vlasov antenna and transmitted to the NMR probe via an optical bench, with beam splitters for monitoring and adjusting the microwave power, a ferrite rotator to isolate the gyrotron from the reflected power and a Martin-Puplett interferometer for adjusting the polarisation. The Gaussian beam is reflected by curved mirrors inside the DNP-MAS-NMR probe to be incident at the sample along the MAS rotation axis. The beam is focussed to a {\~{}}1 mm waist at the top of the rotor and then gradually diverges to give much more efficient coupling throughout the sample than designs using direct waveguide irradiation. The probe can be used in triple channel HXY mode for 600 MHz (1)H and double channel HX mode for 284 MHz (1)H, with MAS sample temperatures ≥85 K. Initial data at 6.7 T and {\~{}}1 W pulsed microwave power are presented with (13)C enhancements of 60 for a frozen urea solution ((1)H-(13)C CP), 16 for bacteriorhodopsin in purple membrane ((1)H-(13)C CP) and 22 for (15)N in a frozen glycine solution ((1)H-(15)N CP) being obtained. In comparison with designs which irradiate perpendicular to the rotation axis the approach used here provides a highly efficient use of the incident microwave beam and an NMR-optimised coil design.},

Then the relations between wavelets, filter banks, and multiresolution signal processing are explored. A brief review is given of perfect reconstruction filter banks, which can be used both for computing the discrete wavelet transform, and for deriving continuous wavelet bases, provided that the filters meet a constraint known as regularity. Given a low-pass filter, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a complementary high-pass filter that will permit perfect reconstruction are derived. The perfect reconstruction condition is posed as a Bezout identity, and it is shown how it is possible to find all higher-degree complementary filters based on an analogy with the theory of Diophantine equations. An alternative approach based on the theory of continued fractions is also given. These results are used to design highly regular filter banks, which generate biorthogonal continuous wavelet bases with symmetries},

This is made possible through the Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of water interacting with stable nitroxide spin labels tethered to specific proteins sites. This effect is highly localized due to the magnetic dipolar nature of the electron-proton spin interaction, with {\textgreater}80{\%} of their interaction occurring within 5 A between the unpaired electron of the spin label and the proton of water. We showcase our tool on the aggregation of tau proteins, whose fibrillization is linked to neurodegenerative disease pathologies known as taupathies. We demonstrate that the DNP approach to monitor local changes in hydration dynamics with residue specificity and local contrast can distinguish specific and neat protein-protein packing leading to fibers from non-specific protein agglomeration or precipitation. The ability to monitor tau assembly with local, residue-specific, resolution, under ambient conditions and in solution state will help unravel the mechanism and structural characteristics of the gradual process of tau aggregation into amyloid fibers, which remains unclear to this day.},

Using spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we found that the two t-SNARE proteins assemble into a parallel four-helix bundle that consists of two identical syntaxin 1A components and the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of SNAP-25. Although the structure is generally similar to that of the final SNARE complex, the middle region of the helical bundle appears more flexible in the t-SNARE complex.

abstract = {Biomacromolecular structures with a relative molecular mass (M(r)) of 50,000 to 100,000 (50K 100K) have been generally considered to be inaccessible to analysis by solution NMR spectroscopy. Here we report spectra recorded from bacterial chaperonin complexes ten times this size limit (up to M(r) 900K) using the techniques of transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy and cross-correlated relaxation-enhanced polarization transfer. These techniques prevent deterioration of the NMR spectra by the rapid transverse relaxation of the magnetization to which large, slowly tumbling molecules are otherwise subject. We tested the resolving power of these techniques by examining the isotope-labelled homoheptameric co-chaperonin GroES (M(r) 72K), either free in solution or in complex with the homotetradecameric chaperonin GroEL (M(r) 800K) or with the single-ring GroEL variant SR1 (M(r) 400K). Most amino acids of GroES show the same resonances whether free in solution or in complex with chaperonin; however, residues 17 32 show large chemical shift changes on binding. These amino acids belong to a mobile loop region of GroES that forms contacts with GroEL. This establishes the utility of these techniques for solution NMR studies that should permit the exploration of structure, dynamics and interactions in large macromolecular complexes.},

  abstract = {Distance measurements by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance techniques are increasingly applied to systems that contain more than two spin labels. Under typical experimental conditions this leads to signal contributions from sum and difference combinations of dipolar frequencies. As these contributions are neglected in the expressions used in data analysis they cause artifacts in distance distributions. It is shown that the artifacts lead to substantial broadening of the distance distribution. By measuring double electron-electron resonance (DEER) data with variable inversion efficiency of the pump pulse and fitting the data at each point in time by appropriate polynomials the pair contribution can be separated from the three-spin contribution. Experiments on a conformationally invariant triradical with equilateral triangle geometry and the corresponding biradical with the same interspin distance demonstrate that this approach leads to a considerable improvement in the distance distribution. The three-spin contribution is shown to provide information on angles between spin-spin vectors. Data for a series of triradicals with equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangle geometry are analysed by fitting a general triangle model simultaneously to the dipolar spectra of the pair and three-spin contribution. The agreement with the expected side lengths of the triangles is satisfying.},

  abstract = {We modified membrane-active peptides with synthetic recognition modules to foster peptide assembly at the lipid-water interface. The designed recognition strategy has been previously reported: tris-cyanuric acid and tris-melamine have been found to bind selectively to each another when membrane-anchored. We designed this interaction to occur between two membrane-active peptides, forming a heteromeric complex at the lipid-water interface that exhibits superior membrane binding and permeation compared to the monomeric peptides, presumably because of the higher avidity of the assembled structure. These conjugates do not assemble appreciably in solution but assemble at the lipid-water interface, with surface binding of the peptide acting cooperatively with molecular recognition to yield improved binding and permeation. Furthermore, we find that specific recognition between tris-cyanuric acid phospholipid (TCA-PE) at low surface concentration and tris-melamine magainin (TMM) or hexa-melamine magainin (HMM) results in highly lytic binding, whereas no binding is detectable in the absence of lipid recognition. These findings suggest a noncovalent strategy to enhance peptide membrane activity, which may lead to the discovery of more potent surface-active agents such as antimicrobials.},

  abstract  = {The use of 2D-electron-electron double resonance (2D-ELDOR) for the characterization of the boundary lipid in membrane vesicles of DPPC and gramicidin A' (GA) is reported. We show that 2D-ELDOR, with its enhanced spectral resolution to dynamic structure as compared with continuous-wave electron spin resonance, provides a reliable and useful way of studying lipid-protein interactions. The 2D-ELDOR spectra of the end-chain spin label 16-PC in DPPC/GA vesicles is composed of two components, which are assigned to the bulk lipids (with sharp auto peaks and crosspeaks) and to the boundary lipids (with broad auto peaks). Their distinction is clearest for higher temperatures and higher GA concentrations. The quantitative analysis of these spectra shows relatively faster motions and very low ordering for the end chain of the bulk lipids, whereas the boundary lipids show very high "y-ordering" and slower motions. The y-ordering represents a dynamic bending at the end of the boundary lipid acyl chain, which can then coat the GA molecules. These results are consistent with the previous studies by Ge and Freed (1999) using continuous-wave electron spin resonance, thereby supporting their model for GA aggregation and H(II) phase formation for high GA concentrations. Improved instrumental and simulation methods have been employed.},

  abstract = {The experimental determination of protein compressibility reflects both the protein intrinsic compressibility and the difference between the compressibility of water in the protein hydration shell and bulk water. We use molecular dynamics simulations to explore the dependence of the isothermal compressibility of the hydration shell surrounding globular proteins on differential contributions from charged, polar, and apolar protein-water interfaces. The compressibility of water in the protein hydration shell is accounted for by a linear combination of contributions from charged, polar, and apolar solvent-accessible surfaces. The results provide a formula for the deconvolution of experimental data into intrinsic and hydration contributions when a protein of known structure is investigated. The physical basis for the model is the variation in water density shown by the surface-specific radial distribution functions of water molecules around globular proteins. The compressibility of water hydrating charged atoms is lower than bulk water compressibility, the compressibility of water hydrating apolar atoms is somewhat larger than bulk water compressibility, and the compressibility of water around polar atoms is about the same as the compressibility of bulk water. We also assess whether hydration water compressibility determined from small compound data can be used to estimate the compressibility of hydration water surrounding proteins. The results, based on an analysis from four dipeptide solutions, indicate that small compound data cannot be used directly to estimate the compressibility of hydration water surrounding proteins.},

  abstract = {Nitroxide spin probe electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has proven to be a very successful method to probe local polarity and solvent hydrogen bonding properties at the molecular level. The g(xx) and the (14)N hyperfine A(zz) principal values are the EPR parameters of the nitroxide spin probe that are sensitive to these properties and are therefore monitored experimentally. Recently, the (14)N quadrupole interaction of nitroxides has been shown to be also highly sensitive to polarity and H-bonding (A. Savitsky et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 112 (2008) 9079). High-field electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) was used successfully to determine the P(xx) and P(yy) principal components of the (14)N quadrupole tensor. The P(zz) value was calculated from the traceless character of the quadrupole tensor. We introduce here high-field (W-band, 95 GHz, 3.5 T) electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR)-detected NMR as a method to obtain the (14)N P(zz) value directly, together with A(zz). This is complemented by W-band hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) measurements carried out along the g(xx) direction to determine the principal P(xx) and P(yy) components. Through measurements of TEMPOL dissolved in solvents of different polarities, we show that A(zz) increases, while |P(zz)| decreases with polarity, as predicted by Savitsky et al.},

  abstract = {The hydration shell model for the excess volume and compressibility is examined. A modified Kirkwood-Buff formula for the excess volume, which is appropriate for use in the canonical ensemble, is presented. Its pressure derivative is shown to be the excess compressibility, which can be expressed as an integral of the local solvent compressibility over the hydration shell. For methane in water, which is chosen as the first application, the local solvent density and compressibility around the solute are calculated from a Monte Carlo simulation as continuous functions of the distance from the solute. The localization of the excess volume and compressibility within the hydration shell is then analyzed in terms of the deviation of the local solvent density and compressibility from their bulk values, respectively. The effect of the exclusion of solvent molecules by the solute is also described for the excess volume. About 80{\%} of the total excess volume is accounted for by the excluded volume effect of the solute plus the deviation of the volume per water molecule in the first hydration shell from that in the bulk, whereas the hydration shell model is not even qualitatively successful for describing the excess compressibility. A condition for the qualitative validity of the hydration shell model is identified. This involves the phase relationship between the local excess quantity and the solute-solvent radial distribution function. On the basis of an analysis of the pressure dependence of the chemical potential, the excess compressibility of the model methane-water solution is found to have a positive sign. This apparent ``softness'' of the ``hydrophobic water'', however, is not simply related to the properties of the first hydration shell.},

abstract = {The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras occurs in solution in two different conformational states, state 1 and state 2 with an equilibrium constant K(12) of 2.0, when the GTP analogue guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate or guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-methyleno)triphosphate is bound to the active centre. State 2 is assumed to represent a strong binding state for effectors with a conformation similar to that found for Ras complexed to effectors. In the other state (state 1), the switch regions of Ras are most probably dynamically disordered. Ras variants that exist predominantly in state 1 show a drastically reduced affinity to effectors. In contrast, Ras(wt) bound to the GTP analogue guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) leads to (31)P NMR spectra that indicate the prevalence of only one conformational state with K(12) {\textgreater} 10. Titration with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-kinase (Raf-RBD) shows that this state corresponds to effector binding state 2. In the GTPgammaS complex of the effector loop mutants Ras(T35S) and Ras(T35A) two conformational states different to state 2 are detected, which interconvert over a millisecond time scale. Binding studies with Raf-RBD suggest that both mutants exist mainly in low-affinity states 1a and 1b. From line-shape analysis of the spectra measured at various temperatures an activation energy DeltaH(|) (1a1b) of 61 kJ.mol(-1) and an activation entropy DeltaS(|) (1a1b) of 65 J.K(-1).mol(-1) are derived. Isothermal titration calorimetry on Ras bound to the different GTP-analogues shows that the effective affinity K(A) for the Raf-RBD to Ras(T35S) is reduced by a factor of about 20 compared to the wild-type with the strongest reduction observed for the GTPgammaS complex.},

The advantages of monitoring the NMR signal at high magnetic fields are increased chemical shift dispersion and greater magnetization flux at the NMR detector. For several different flowing fluids, the enhancement of the low field polarized signal exceeds the normal thermal Boltzmann magnetization for a high magnetic field system (4.7 T). Stable nitroxide radical systems immobilized on silica gel were utilized in these flow solid/liquid intermolecular transfer (SLIT) 1H DNP experiments.},

We show that carefully designed experiments along with real-time AFM imaging with superior lateral and z resolution (0.1 nm) have revealed quantitative details of the mechanisms and factors controlling vesicle rupture, domain shape and size, phase transformations, and some model biological interactions. The AFM tip can also be used as a mechanical transducer and incorporated in electrochemical measurements of membrane components; therefore, we touch on these important applications in both model and cell membranes.},

Z. 24 (1923) 185-206.] and its successors utilize a macroscopic dielectric constant and assume that all interactions involving ions are strictly electrostatic, implying that simple ions in water generate electric fields strong enough to orient water dipoles over long distances. However, solution neutron and X-ray diffraction indicate that even di- and tri-valent ions do not significantly alter the density or orientation of water more than two water molecules (5 A) away. Therefore the long range electric fields (generated by simple ions) which can be detected by various resonance techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer over distances of 30 A (about 11 water diameters) or more must be weak relative to the strength of water-water interactions. Two different techniques indicate that the interaction of water with anions is by an approximately linear hydrogen bond, suggesting that the dominant forces on ions in water are short range forces of a chemical nature.},

  abstract = {The condensation of bacteriophage phi29 genomic DNA into its preformed procapsid requires the DNA packaging motor, which is the strongest known biological motor. The packaging motor is an intricate ring-shaped protein/RNA complex, and its function requires an RNA component called packaging RNA (pRNA). Current structural information on pRNA is limited, which hinders studies of motor function. Here, we used site-directed spin labeling to map the conformation of a pRNA three-way junction that bridges binding sites for the motor ATPase and the procapsid. The studies were carried out on a pRNA dimer, which is the simplest ring-shaped pRNA complex and serves as a functional intermediate during motor assembly. Using a nucleotide-independent labeling scheme, stable nitroxide radicals were attached to eight specific pRNA sites without perturbing RNA folding and dimer formation, and a total of 17 internitroxide distances spanning the three-way junction were measured using Double Electron-Electron Resonance spectroscopy. The measured distances, together with steric chemical constraints, were used to select 3662 viable three-way junction models from a pool of 65 billion. The results reveal a similar conformation among the viable models, with two of the helices (H(T) and H(L)) adopting an acute bend. This is in contrast to a recently reported pRNA tetramer crystal structure, in which H(T) and H(L) stack onto each other linearly. The studies establish a new method for mapping global structures of complex RNA molecules, and provide information on pRNA conformation that aids investigations of phi29 packaging motor and developments of pRNA-based nanomedicine and nanomaterial.},

A stable, spherical nitroxide spin probe, perdeuterated 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-oxopiperidine-1-oxyl, is studied using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), taking advantage of the fact that the rotational correlation time, $\tau$(R), the mean time between successive spin exchanges within a cage, $\tau$(RE), and the long-time-averaged spin exchange rate constants, K(ex), of the same solute molecule may be measured independently. Thus, long- and short-time translational diffusion behavior may be inferred from K(ex) and $\tau$(RE), respectively. In order to measure K(ex), the effects of dipole-dipole interactions (DD) on the EPR spectra must be separated, yielding as a bonus the DD broadening rate constants that are related to the dephasing rate constant due to DD, W(dd). We find that both K(ex) and W(dd) behave hydrodynamically; that is to say they vary monotonically with T/$\eta$ or $\eta$/T, respectively, where $\eta$ is the shear viscosity, as predicted by the Stokes-Einstein equation. The same is true of the self-diffusion of water. In contrast, $\tau$(RE) does not follow hydrodynamic behavior, varying rather as a linear function of the density reaching a maximum at 276 ± 2 K near where water displays a maximum density.},

These frequencies are further used to determine hyperfine and quadrupolar couplings, which are signatures of the electronic and spatial structures of paramagnetic centers. In recent years, EDNMR has been shown to be particularly useful at high fields/high frequencies, such as W-band (∼95 GHz, ∼3.5 T), for low $\gamma$ quadrupolar nuclei. Although at high fields the nuclear Larmor frequencies are usually well resolved, the limited resolution of EDNMR still remains a major concern. In this work we introduce a two dimensional, triple resonance, correlation experiment based on the EDNMR pulse sequence, which we term 2D-EDNMR. This experiment allows circumventing the resolution limitation by spreading the signals in two dimensions and the observed correlations help in the assignment of the signals. First we demonstrate the utility of the 2D-EDNMR experiment on a nitroxide spin label, where we observe correlations between (14)N nuclear frequencies. Negative cross-peaks appear between lines belonging to different MS electron spin manifolds. We resolved two independent correlation patterns for nuclear frequencies arising from the EPR transitions corresponding to the (14)N mI=0 and mI=-1 nuclear spin states, which severely overlap in the one dimensional EDNMR spectrum. The observed correlations could be accounted for by considering changes in the populations of energy levels that S=1/2, I=1 spin systems undergo during the pulse sequence. In addition to these negative cross-peaks, positive cross-peaks appear as well. We present a theoretical model based on the Liouville equation and use it to calculate the time evolution of populations of the various energy levels during the 2D-EDNMR experiment and generated simulated 2D-EDMR spectra. These calculations show that the positive cross-peaks appear due to off resonance effects and/or nuclear relaxation effects. These results suggest that the 2D-EDNMR experiment can be also useful for relaxation pathway studies. Finally we present preliminary results demonstrating that 2D-EDNMR can resolve overlapping (33)S and (14)N signals of type 1 Cu(II) center in (33)S enriched Azurin.},

  abstract = {A detailed electron spin resonance (ESR) study of spin-labeled-oriented multilayers of L alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) water systems for low water content (2-10{\%} by weight) is reported with the purpose of characterizing the dynamical and structural properties of model membrane systems. Emphasis is placed on the value of combining such experiments with detailed simulations based on current slow-motional theories. Information is obtained regarding ordering and anisotropic rotational diffusion rates via ESR lineshape analysis over the entire motional range, from the fast motional region through the moderately slow and slow to the rigid limit. This includes the low-temperature gel phase, the liquid crystalline L alpha (1) phase and what appears to be a third high-temperature phase above the L alpha phase. Cholestane (CSL) and spin-labeled DPPC (5-PC, 8-PC, and 16-PC) have been used to probe different depths of the bilayer. While CSL and 5-PC both reflect the high ordering of the bilayer close to the lipid-water interface, CSL appears to be located close enough to the water for the nitroxide to be involved in hydrogen bonding with water molecules. 16-PC reflects the relatively low ordering near the tail of the hydrocarbon chain in the bilayer. Quantitative estimates of ordering and motion are obtained for these cases. The results from CSL indicate that close to the lipid-water interface the DPPC molecule is oriented approximately perpendicular to the bilayer in these low water-content systems. However, all three labeled lipid probes indicate that the hydrocarbon chain of DPPC may be bent away from the bilayer normal by as much as 30 degrees and this evidence is stronger at low temperatures. When cholesterol is added to the DPPC-water system at a concentration greater than or equal to 2.5 mol {\%}, the ordering is greatly increased although the rotational diffusion rate remains almost unaffected in the gel phase. Electron spin echoes (ESE) are observed for the first time from oriented lipid-water multilayers. Results obtained from cw ESR lineshape analysis are correlated with data from ESE experiments, which give a more direct measurement of relaxation times. These results indicate that for detection of very slow motions (close to the rigid limit) ESE experiments are more sensitive to dynamics than continuous wave ESR for which inhomogeneous broadening becomes a major problem.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a new method, called entangled photon-pair two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (EPP-2DFS), to sensitively probe the nonlinear electronic response of molecular systems. The method incorporates a separated two-photon ('Franson') interferometer, which generates time-frequency-entangled photon pairs, into the framework of a fluorescence-detected 2D optical spectroscopic experiment. The entangled photons are temporally shaped and phase-modulated in the interferometer, and are used to excite a two-photon-absorbing (TPA) sample, whose excited-state population is selectively detected by simultaneously monitoring the sample fluorescence and the exciting fields. In comparison to 'classical' 2DFS techniques, major advantages of this scheme are the suppression of uncorrelated background signals, the enhancement of simultaneous time-and-frequency resolution, the suppression of diagonal 2D spectral features, and the enhancement and narrowing of off-diagonal spectral cross-peaks that contain information about electronic couplings. These effects are a consequence of the pure-state field properties unique to a parametric down-conversion light source, which must be included in the quantum mechanical description of the composite field-molecule system. We numerically simulate the EPP-2DFS observable for the case of an electronically coupled molecular dimer. The EPP-2DFS spectrum is greatly simplified in comparison to its classical 2D counterpart. Our results indicate that EPP-2DFS can provide previously unattainable resolution to extract model Hamiltonian parameters from electronically coupled molecular dimers.},

  abstract   = {We present a unique analysis tool for the selective detection of local water inside soft molecular assemblies (hydrophobic cores, vesicular bilayers, and micellar structures) suspended in bulk water. Through the use of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), the (1)H NMR signal of water is amplified, as it interacts with stable radicals that possess approximately 658 times higher spin polarization. We utilized stable nitroxide radicals covalently attached along the hydrophobic tail of stearic acid molecules that incorporate themselves into surfactant-based micelle or vesicle structures. Here, we present a study of local water content and fluid viscosity inside oleate micelles and vesicles and Triton X-100 micelles to serve as model systems for soft molecular assemblies. This approach is unique because the amplification of the NMR signal is performed in bulk solution and under ambient conditions with site-specific spin labels that only detect the water that is directly interacting with the localized spin labels. Continuous wave (cw) electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis provides rotational dynamics of the spin-labeled molecular chain segments and local polarity parameters that can be related to hydration properties, whereas we show that DNP-enhanced (1)H NMR analysis of fluid samples directly provides translational water dynamics and permeability of the local environment probed by the spin label. Our technique therefore has the potential to become a powerful analysis tool, complementary to cw ESR, to study hydration characteristics of surfactant assemblies, lipid bilayers, or protein aggregates, where water dynamics is a key parameter of their structure and function. In this study, we find that there is significant penetration of water inside the oleate micelles with a higher average local water viscosity (approximately 1.8 cP) than in bulk water, and Triton X-100 micelles and oleate vesicle bilayers mostly exclude water while allowing for considerable surfactant chain motion and measurable water permeation through the soft structure.},

  abstract  = {Hydration shell dynamics plays a critical role in protein folding and biochemical activity and has thus been actively studied through a broad range of techniques. While all observations concur with a slowdown of water dynamics relative to the bulk, the magnitude and molecular origin of this retardation remain unclear. Via numerical simulations and theoretical modeling, we establish a molecular description of protein hydration dynamics and identify the key protein features that govern it. Through detailed microscopic mapping of the water reorientation and hydrogen-bond (HB) dynamics around lysozyme, we first determine that 80{\%} of the hydration layer waters experience a moderate slowdown factor of {\~{}}2-3, while the slower residual population is distributed along a power-law tail, in quantitative agreement with recent NMR results. We then establish that the water reorientation mechanism at the protein interface is dominated by large angular jumps similar to the bulk situation. A theoretical extended jump model is shown to provide the first rigorous determination of the two key contributions to the observed slowdown: a topological excluded-volume factor resulting from the local protein geometry, which governs the dynamics of the fastest 80{\%} of the waters, and a free energetic factor arising from the water-protein HB strength, which is especially important for the remaining waters in confined sites at the protein interface. These simple local factors are shown to provide a nearly quantitative description of the hydration shell dynamics.},

  abstract = {A phenomenological theory of salt-induced Hofmeister phenomena is presented, based on a relation between protein solubility in salt solutions and protein-water interfacial tension. As a generalization of previous treatments, it implies that both kosmotropic salting out and chaotropic salting in are manifested via salt-induced changes of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of protein-water interfaces. The theory is applied to describe the salt-dependent free energy profiles of proteins as a function of their water-exposed surface area. On this basis, three classes of protein conformations have been distinguished, and their existence experimentally demonstrated using the examples of bacteriorhodopsin and myoglobin. The experimental results support the ability of the new formalism to account for the diverse manifestations of salt effects on protein conformation, dynamics, and stability, and to resolve the puzzle of chaotropes stabilizing certain proteins (and other anomalies). It is also shown that the relation between interfacial tension and protein structural stability is straightforwardly linked to protein conformational fluctuations, providing a keystone for the microscopic interpretation of Hofmeister effects. Implications of the results concerning the use of Hofmeister effects in the experimental study of protein function are discussed.},

The ensemble covers the complete structural heterogeneity observed in 46 ubiquitin crystal structures, most of which are complexes with other proteins. Conformational selection, rather than induced-fit motion, thus suffices to explain the molecular recognition dynamics of ubiquitin. Marked correlations are seen between the flexibility of the ensemble and contacts formed in ubiquitin complexes. A large part of the solution dynamics is concentrated in one concerted mode, which accounts for most of ubiquitin's molecular recognition heterogeneity and ensures a low entropic complex formation cost.},

Strong-field control appears to have generic applicability for manipulating molecular reactivity because the tailored intense laser fields (about 10(13) watts per square centimeter) can dynamically Stark shift many excited states into resonance, and consequently, the method is not confined by resonant spectral restrictions found in the perturbative (weak-field) regime.},

  abstract = {We have recently proposed a protocol for retrieving multidimensional magnetic resonance spectra and images within a single scan, based on a spatial encoding of the spin interactions. The spatial selectivity of this encoding process also opens up new possibilities for compensating magnetic field inhomogeneities; not by demanding extreme uniformities from the B(0) fields, but by compensating for their effects at an excitation and/or refocusing level. This potential is hereby discussed and demonstrated in connection with the single-scan acquisition of high-definition multidimensional images. It is shown that in combination with time-dependent gradient and radiofrequency manipulations, the new compensation approach can be used to counteract substantial field inhomogenities at either global or local levels over relatively long periods of time. The new compensation scheme could find uses in areas where heterogeneities in magnetic fields present serious obstacles, including rapid studies in regions near tissue/air interfaces. The principles of the B(0) compensation method are reviewed for one- and higher-dimensional cases, and experimentally demonstrated on a series of 1D and 2D single-scan MRI experiments on simple phantoms.},

abstract = {Frequency-modulated (FM) pulses have practical advantages for spin-echo experiments, such as the ability to produce a broadband pi rotation, with an inhomogeneous radiofrequency (RF) field. However, such use leads to a nonlinear phase of the transverse magnetization, which is why FM pulses like the hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse are not commonly used for multislice spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, a general theory and methods are described for conventional spin-echo imaging using a pi HS pulse for refocusing. Phase profiles produced by the HS pulse are analytically described. The analysis is extended to yield the specific relationships between pulse parameters and gradients, which must be satisfied to compensate the nonlinear phase variation produced with a spin-echo sequence composed of pi/2 and pi HS pulses (the pi/2 HS - pi HS sequence). The latter offers advantages for multislice spin-echo MRI, including excellent slice-selection and partial compensation for RF inhomogeneity. Furthermore, it can be implemented with a shorter echo time and lower power deposition than a previously described method using a pair of pi HS pulses.},

abstract = {Frequency-swept pulses are not typically employed to excite spins in NMR. When used for selective excitation in MRI, such pulses do not produce a proper echo because the phase of the transverse magnetization varies in a quadratic manner across the slice or slab. Previously, frequency-swept pulses such as the chirp pulse have been shown to offer an approach to reduce the peak radiofrequency power required for excitation. It has also been shown that chirp excitation produces a unique type of echo (dubbed "pseudo-echo" here) and images can be generated from the resultant pseudo-echoes using a quadratic reconstruction method (J.G. Pipe, Magn Reson Med 1995;33:24-33). The present work describes a general theory and methods for exciting spins with other types of frequency-swept pulses (HSn pulses), which offer the advantage of delivering better excitation profiles than the chirp pulse. Here, pseudo-echoes are produced with HSn pulses in conventional gradient-echo 3D MRI, and high-quality images are reconstructed using standard fast Fourier transformation. An optional apodization procedure using a sliding window function is also introduced. When the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter is limiting, signal-to-noise ratio of pseudo-echo imaging is superior to that obtained with standard excitations.},

Optimal control enables efficient optimization of NMR experiments in terms of amplitudes, phases, offsets etc. for hundreds-to-thousands of pulses to fully exploit the experimentally available high degree of freedom in pulse sequences to combat variations/limitations in experimental or spin system parameters or design experiments with specific properties typically not covered as easily by standard design procedures. This facilitates straightforward optimization of experiments under consideration of rf and static field inhomogeneities, limitations in available or desired rf field strengths (e.g., for reduction of sample heating), spread in resonance offsets or coupling parameters, variations in spin systems etc. to meet the actual experimental conditions as close as possible. The paper provides a brief account on the relevant theory and in particular the computational interface relevant for optimization of state-to-state transfer (on the density operator level) and the effective Hamiltonian on the level of propagators along with several representative examples within liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.},
