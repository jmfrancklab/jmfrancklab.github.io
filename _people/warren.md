Warren has two projects:
In one, he develops efficient protocols for site-directed spin labeling and
expression of the light-activated proton pump proteorhodopsin,
and investigates sites with anomalous hydration along the surface
or proteorhodopsin.
In the other project, he employes Ansys Electronics
to design dual NMR-ESR resonators with improved sensitivity.
He focuses on developing new simulation protocols that apply
broadly to the design of couple microwave resonators.
