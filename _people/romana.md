Romana is a 1<sup>st</sup> year graduate student.
She synthesizes small molecule spin labels that allow her to probe the
microviscosity (*via* ESR)
and the local diffusivity (*via* ODNP) of small pockets of water.
Beginning with reverse micelles, she plans to expand her studies to
a variety of (especially energy-relevant) porous materials.
