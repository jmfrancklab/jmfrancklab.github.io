Alex has automated large portions of the ODNP experiment and data
processing,
and performs detailed investigations to improve the sensitivity of the
ODNP measurement.
Currently, she applies these techniques to the study of hydration
water on the surface of Ras as well as exploring 
the benefits of data processing in the time domain for both
NMR and QESR data.
