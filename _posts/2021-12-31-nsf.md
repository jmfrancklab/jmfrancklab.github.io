Lab PI J.M. Franck awarded NSF CAREER award
"Spin Dynamics Measurements of Site-to-Site Variations in Hydration Water at Soft Nanoscale Interfaces" (2146270).
This funding will allow us to explore patches and pockets of water on the surface of proteins and materials and to learn how to tap into the chemical energy available from the hydration layer!
