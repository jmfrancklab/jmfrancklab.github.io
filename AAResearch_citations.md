## General

Even though water appears uniform
    on a macroscopic scale,
    it behaves quite differently
    on the nanoscale.
If we zoom in to the first few layers of water
    molecules near a surface,
    we see that
    hydrogen bonds break
    and
    individual water molecules move
    at rates
    anywhere from a couple times
    slower to hundreds of times slower than those in the bulk
    liquid.
In both biomolecules and synthetic materials,
    we know that these differently behaved "hydration waters" are
    key to determining interactions.
The layer of water surrounding oil molecules
    that drive the separation of water and oil are the
    simplest example of hydration water,
    but the more general case,
    especially for macromolecules that present a
    surface with variable properties to the solvent,
    is far more interesting.

## Our goal:

Since comprehensive methods for mapping out
    the structure of the hydration layer do not
    currently exist,
    the acquisition of this information is crucial
    to the future development of the chemistry of
    macromolecules.
The resulting insight will improve our ability
    to design drugs and synthetic materials.
In particular,
    we specialize in magnetic resonance techniques
    that communicate with both electron and nuclear
    spins to probe nanometer-scale structure and
    dynamics.

For example, proteins are the molecular motors
    that drive all life,
    and most drugs are designed to interact with
    proteins.
It is increasingly clear that water molecules
    at the surface of proteins control their
    structure and function;
    while researchers have developed methods that
    can study the structure of proteins,
    there are no accessible methods to spatially
    map the hydration water.
Similarly,
    researchers have identified a direct link
    between the behavior of hydration water
    associated with synthetic materials and the
    properties of those materials.
We develop and apply magnetic-resonance-based
    spectroscopic methods for routine, robust,
    and accessible measurements of the properties
    of these key hydration water molecules.


## Why hydration water?
While tools have been developed for
    characterizing static structures,
    we still need techniques that can study
    dynamic arrangements of molecules
    and, most urgently,
    the arrangement
    of water molecules.


# Chemical Labeling Strategy

Our work relies on a simple chemical labeling strategy:

## Initial examples:
As a fundamental example,
    we looked at lipid bilayers
    -- structures that make up cell membranes.
We developed (at other institutions) a specialized technique to
    characterize water near the bilayer surfaces.
Our technique
    -- called Overhauser Effect Dynamic Nuclear
    Polarization (ODNP) [@FranckPNMRS] --
    tracks the motion of the water nuclei,
    and allows us to zoom in on the
    "hydration water" near the surface of the lipid bilayer
    (figure below).
It allowed us to
    see that the hydration water moves about 5
    times slower than bulk water [@Franck_crowding].
Furthermore, by dramatically
    changing the characteristics of the bulk
    solution,
    we learned that
    an order of magnitude change in the viscosity
    barely affects the diffusion in the hydration
    layer [@Franck_crowding].
We have also implemented this technique
    in systems with membrane proteins [@Hussain2013],
    DNA [@Franck2015DNA],
    and large protein folding chaperones [@FranckGroES].
The significant variations in the properties of the
    hydration water play in important role in how these surfaces
    interact in nature.

*This image illustrates ODNP of water in the hydration layer of a
    lipid bilayer.
This is one example of many studies that are possible with ODNP.
A lipid bilayer (the basis for cellular membranes) consists of a
    self-organized set of molecules with hydrophilic headgroups
    and hydrophobic tails (see labels above).
One can place a spin label (typically a nitroxide group)
    at a particular location near the surface of the lipid
    bilayer (via chemical synthesis).
A combination of electron- and nuclear-spin resonance
    (i.e. ODNP)
    can selectively interrogate the motion of water molecules
    at a specific location --
    here inside the hydration layer of
    the lipid bilayer.
For example, employing the setup shown above,
    we were able to verify that the motion of water molecules
    within the hydration layer was not sensitive to the presence
    of a high concentration of large molecules
    that are not chemically disposed to disrupt the hydration layer.
This was even true when the large molecules significantly altered the
    viscosity of the bulk solution [@Franck_crowding].*

## The future:
In the Franck lab,
    we will extend the power
    of ODNP-based techniques and integrate them with a toolbox of
    previously developed techniques, for example:
    NMR techniques that can measure
    microscopic diffusion and flow,
    as well as electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques that interrogate local
    motions (cw ESR),
    that measure nanometer-scale distances (double
    electron-electron resonance, i.e. "DEER”)
    and that map out local arrangements of nuclei
    (electron-nuclear double resonance, *i.e.* "ENDOR" and electron spin echo
    envelope modulation, i.e. "ESEEM” [@FranckGroES]).
Towards these ends,
    we will draw on expertise in spectrometer design
    [@FranckBarnes2015;@Kaufmann2013;@Demas2009]
    and advanced magnetic resonance methods
    [@FranckFreed2015;@Franck2009].
We will also apply techniques that we have already developed to
    systems that remain poorly understood,
    despite their central importance
    to understanding
    materials function or to understanding disease.
For example, *the Ras protein system* is integral to cell signal
    pathways and the development of novel cancer drugs,
    *polymer electrolyte membranes* are essential to ion transport
    in H~2~/O~2~- and methanol-based fuel cells
    -- as well as sensor devices,
    while biological light-harvesting systems, such as
    *Photosystem II*,
    are believed to integrate nanoscale water channels to aid in
    their function.
Nonetheless, the interplay between all these systems and water has yet to be
    fully explored.
