## Hydration Water

Even though water appears uniform on a macroscopic scale, it behaves
quite differently on the nanoscale. If we zoom in to the first few
layers of water molecules near the surface of a protein or polymer (in
fact, near any macromolecule or macromolecular assembly), we see that
hydrogen bonds break and individual water molecules move at rates
anywhere from two times slower to hundreds of times slower than those in
the bulk liquid. We know that these differently behaved "hydration
waters" are key to determining interactions.

The future of physical and analytical chemistry will center on the fact
that, while tools have been developed for characterizing static
structures, we still need techniques that can study dynamic arrangements
of molecules and, most urgently, the arrangement of water molecules.

Comprehensive methods for mapping out the structure of the hydration
layer do not currently exist. The future of chemistry, broadly, depends
on techniques that will map out the structure of the dynamic solvent
that surrounds macromolecules. The resulting insight will improve our
ability to design drugs and synthetic materials. In particular, by
developing technologies that can map out the dynamic structure of
hydration water, we unlock an ability to design drugs that bind to
proteins currently deemed "undruggable," we can understand the
energetics that cause signaling proteins to bind to their partners, and
design polymer materials that conduct water in unique ways.

Most chemists and biologists recognize one very simple example of
hydration water: the layer of water surrounding oil molecules that drive
the separation of water and oil. But the more general case, especially
for macromolecules that present a surface with variable properties to
the solvent, is far more interesting and far less understood.

## How do Proteins Alter Nearby Solvent?

Proteins are the molecular motors that drive all life, and most drugs
are designed to interact with proteins. It is increasingly clear that
water molecules at the surface of proteins control their structure and
function; while researchers have developed methods that can study the
structure of proteins, there are no accessible methods to spatially map
the hydration water. We develop and apply magnetic-resonance-based
spectroscopic methods for routine, robust, and accessible measurements
of the properties of these key hydration water molecules.

## A fundamental example

As a fundamental example, consider lipid bilayers -- structures that
make up cell membranes. Dr. Franck and his colleagues previously
developed a specialized technique to characterize water near the bilayer
surfaces. Our technique -- called Overhauser Effect Dynamic Nuclear
Polarization (ODNP)<sup>1,2</sup> -- tracks the motion of the water nuclei, and
allows us to zoom in on the "hydration water" near the surface of the
lipid bilayer (figure below). It allowed them to see that the hydration
water moves about 5 times slower than bulk water<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, by
dramatically changing the characteristics of the bulk solution, we
learned that an order of magnitude change in the viscosity barely
affects the diffusion in the hydration layer<sup>3</sup>. They have also
implemented this technique in systems with membrane proteins<sup>4</sup>, DNA<sup>5</sup>,
and large protein folding chaperones<sup>6</sup>. The significant variations in
the properties of the hydration water play in important role in how
these surfaces interact in nature.

*This image illustrates ODNP of water in the hydration layer of a lipid
bilayer. This is one example of many studies that are possible with
ODNP. A lipid bilayer (the basis for cellular membranes) consists of a
self-organized set of molecules with hydrophilic headgroups and
hydrophobic tails (see labels above). One can place a spin label
(typically a nitroxide group) at a particular location near the surface
of the lipid bilayer (via chemical synthesis). A combination of
electron- and nuclear-spin resonance (i.e. ODNP) can selectively
interrogate the motion of water molecules at a specific location -- here
inside the hydration layer of the lipid bilayer. For example, employing
the setup shown above, we were able to verify that the motion of water
molecules within the hydration layer was not sensitive to the presence
of a high concentration of large molecules that are not chemically
disposed to disrupt the hydration layer. This was even true when the
large molecules significantly altered the viscosity of the bulk
solution<sup>3</sup>.*

## Current Research:

In the Franck lab, we currently push the limits of the ODNP technique to
retrieve new and more detailed information about hydration water.
Towards this end, we draw on expertise in spectrometer design<sup>7--9</sup> and
advanced magnetic resonance methods<sup>10,11</sup>. We have already developed a
cogent explanation of the ODNP technique<sup>2</sup>, as well as a new, powerful,
and general scheme for visualizing and processing magnetic resonance
data<sup>12</sup>. We are investigating the water on the insides of reverse
micelles, which provide controllable pockets of water, as well as
mapping out more subtle details in the water along the surface of
proteins, both globular signaling proteins, as well as trans-membrane
proteins.
