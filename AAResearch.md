Hydration Water
---------------

Even though water appears uniform on a macroscopic scale, it behaves
quite differently on the nanoscale. If we zoom in to the first few
layers of water molecules near the surface of a protein or polymer (in
fact, near any macromolecule or macromolecular assembly), we see that
hydrogen bonds break and individual water molecules move at rates
anywhere from two times slower to hundreds of times slower than those in
the bulk liquid. We know that these differently behaved "hydration
waters" are key to determining interactions.

The future of physical and analytical chemistry will center on the fact
that, while tools have been developed for characterizing static
structures, we still need techniques that can study dynamic arrangements
of molecules and, most urgently, the arrangement of water molecules.

Comprehensive methods for mapping out the structure of the hydration
layer do not currently exist. The future of chemistry, broadly, depends
on techniques that will map out the structure of the dynamic solvent
that surrounds macromolecules. The resulting insight will improve our
ability to design drugs and synthetic materials. In particular, by
developing technologies that can map out the dynamic structure of
hydration water, we unlock an ability to design drugs that bind to
proteins currently deemed "undruggable," we can understand the
energetics that cause signaling proteins to bind to their partners, and
design polymer materials that conduct water in unique ways. We can do
all of this not be relying on our prowess as chemists, but through a
direct and logical strategy.

Most chemists and biologists can recognize one very specific example of
hydration water: The layer of water surrounding oil molecules that drive
the separation of water and oil are the simplest example of hydration
water, but the more general case, especially for macromolecules that
present a surface with variable properties to the solvent, is far more
interesting.

How do Proteins Alter Nearby Solvent?
-------------------------------------

Proteins are the molecular motors that drive all life, and most drugs
are designed to interact with proteins. It is increasingly clear that
water molecules at the surface of proteins control their structure and
function; while researchers have developed methods that can study the
structure of proteins, there are no accessible methods to spatially map
the hydration water. We develop and apply magnetic-resonance-based
spectroscopic methods for routine, robust, and accessible measurements
of the properties of these key hydration water molecules.

An exciting example
-------------------

As a fundamental example, we looked at lipid bilayers -- structures that
make up cell membranes. We developed (at other institutions) a
specialized technique to characterize water near the bilayer surfaces.
Our technique -- called Overhauser Effect Dynamic Nuclear Polarization
(ODNP)<sup>1</sup> -- tracks the motion of the water nuclei, and allows us to
zoom in on the "hydration water" near the surface of the lipid bilayer
(figure below). It allowed us to see that the hydration water moves
about 5 times slower than bulk water<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, by dramatically
changing the characteristics of the bulk solution, we learned that an
order of magnitude change in the viscosity barely affects the diffusion
in the hydration layer<sup>2</sup>. We have also implemented this technique in
systems with membrane proteins<sup>3</sup>, DNA<sup>4</sup>, and large protein folding
chaperones<sup>5</sup>. The significant variations in the properties of the
hydration water play in important role in how these surfaces interact in
nature.

*This image illustrates ODNP of water in the hydration layer of a lipid
bilayer. This is one example of many studies that are possible with
ODNP. A lipid bilayer (the basis for cellular membranes) consists of a
self-organized set of molecules with hydrophilic headgroups and
hydrophobic tails (see labels above). One can place a spin label
(typically a nitroxide group) at a particular location near the surface
of the lipid bilayer (via chemical synthesis). A combination of
electron- and nuclear-spin resonance (i.e. ODNP) can selectively
interrogate the motion of water molecules at a specific location -- here
inside the hydration layer of the lipid bilayer. For example, employing
the setup shown above, we were able to verify that the motion of water
molecules within the hydration layer was not sensitive to the presence
of a high concentration of large molecules that are not chemically
disposed to disrupt the hydration layer. This was even true when the
large molecules significantly altered the viscosity of the bulk
solution<sup>2</sup>.*

The future:
-----------

In the Franck lab, we will extend the power of ODNP-based techniques and
integrate them with a toolbox of previously developed techniques, for
example: NMR techniques that can measure microscopic diffusion and flow,
as well as electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques that interrogate
local motions (cw ESR), that measure nanometer-scale distances (double
electron-electron resonance, i.e. "DEER") and that map out local
arrangements of nuclei (electron-nuclear double resonance, *i.e.*
"ENDOR" and electron spin echo envelope modulation, i.e. "ESEEM"<sup>5</sup>).
Towards these ends, we will draw on expertise in spectrometer
design<sup>6--8</sup> and advanced magnetic resonance methods<sup>9,10</sup>. We will also
apply techniques that we have already developed to systems that remain
poorly understood, despite their central importance to understanding
materials function or to understanding disease. For example, *the Ras
protein system* is integral to cell signal pathways and the development
of novel cancer drugs, *polymer electrolyte membranes* are essential to
ion transport in H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>- and methanol-based fuel cells -- as well as
sensor devices, while biological light-harvesting systems, such as
*Photosystem II*, are believed to integrate nanoscale water channels to
aid in their function. Nonetheless, the interplay between all these
systems and water has yet to be fully explored.
